# Enhanced Plugin UI Error Handling - Integration Complete! ‚úÖ

## What's Been Added

Your noisetown HTML file now has **comprehensive error handling** for all plugin rack operations!

### 1. Error Handling Utilities (Added at the top of `<script>`)

```javascript
window.PluginRackErrorHandling = {
  formatApiError,        // Smart error message formatting with contextual tips
  withRetry,            // Automatic retry with exponential backoff
  apiFetch,             // Enhanced fetch with better error messages
  validatePluginUiRequirements,  // Pre-flight validation
  withHostStateLock     // Safe state management
}
```

### 2. Updated Functions

All critical plugin rack functions now use the enhanced error handling:

- ‚úÖ `toggleHostEditor()` - Pre-validates requirements, uses safe state management
- ‚úÖ `loadSelectedIntoHost()` - Enhanced with retry and better error messages
- ‚úÖ `unloadHost()` - Safe state management
- ‚úÖ `previewHost()` - Error handling with helpful tips
- ‚úÖ `refreshHostStatus()` - Automatic retry on failure
- ‚úÖ `openDesktopHost()` - Retry logic for transient failures

### 3. What You'll See Now

**Before:**
```
Plugin UI toggle failed: status 500
```

**After:**
```
‚ùå Qt is not available. Plugin UIs require PyQt5. Install with: pip install PyQt5

üí° Tip: This is a Qt-related error. Make sure PyQt5 is installed with: pip install PyQt5
```

## How to Use

Just open your noisetown HTML file and:

1. **Try loading a plugin** - If something goes wrong, you'll get clear, actionable error messages
2. **Network issues?** - The system automatically retries with backoff
3. **Plugin doesn't have UI?** - You'll get a helpful explanation instead of a generic error
4. **Qt not installed?** - You'll see the exact pip command to fix it

## Test It Out

### Test 1: Network Error
1. Stop the Ambiance server
2. Try to refresh the plugin rack
3. **Expected**: Clear message with command to start the server

### Test 2: Qt Not Available
1. Try to show a plugin UI without PyQt5 installed
2. **Expected**: Message explaining what's needed and how to install it

### Test 3: Plugin Without UI
1. Load a parameter-only plugin
2. Try to show UI
3. **Expected**: Explanation that the plugin doesn't have a UI
