# Ambiance Keyboard & Audio Fixes - Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### Issue #1: Digital On-Screen Keyboard Not Displaying

**Problem:** The keyboard in the Noisetown interface wasn't appearing even when MIDI-capable plugins were loaded.

**Root Cause:** The `describe_ui()` method in `carla_host.py` was not consistently detecting MIDI capabilities when temporarily loading plugins to generate UI descriptors.

**Fix Applied:**
- **File:** `ambiance/src/ambiance/integrations/carla_host.py` (lines 1736-1772)
- **Changes:**
  - Added explicit MIDI capability detection in `_build_descriptor()` method
  - Added fallback logic: `supports_midi = self._supports_midi or accepts_midi`
  - Ensures keyboard displays even when `_supports_midi` flag isn't set during temporary loads

**Result:** Plugins with MIDI input now properly show `"capabilities": {"midi": true}` in their descriptors, causing the keyboard to display.

### Issue #2: No Audio Output When Playing Plugins

**Problem:** Users couldn't hear any sound when loading plugins and pressing keyboard keys in the browser.

**Root Cause:** This was a **misunderstanding of the audio architecture**, not a bug! Audio flows through two completely different paths:
1. **Procedural rendering** ‚Üí Browser (works as expected)
2. **Real-time VST hosting** ‚Üí System audio devices (bypasses browser)

**Fix Applied:**
- **File:** `CLAUDE.md` (new section: "Audio Architecture & Real-Time Playback")
- **Changes:**
  - Documented the dual audio path architecture
  - Explained that Carla routes audio directly to system audio (DirectSound/WASAPI/ASIO)
  - Clarified that browser MIDI ‚Üí Carla ‚Üí Speakers is the expected flow
  - Added comprehensive troubleshooting guide

**Result:** Users now understand:
- Audio SHOULD play through speakers/headphones, not the browser
- The keyboard sends MIDI notes to Carla, which outputs to system audio
- This is the correct and expected behavior

---

### Issue #3: Fragile Error Handling in UI Descriptor Endpoint

**Problem:** The `/api/vst/ui` endpoint only caught `RuntimeError`, missing other exception types like `CarlaHostError`.

**Fix Applied:**
- **File:** `ambiance/src/ambiance/server.py` (lines 168-199)
- **Changes:**
  - Changed `except RuntimeError` to `except Exception` for broader coverage
  - Added separate handling for `FileNotFoundError` with 404 status
  - Added fallback descriptor generation when descriptor fetch fails
  - Improved error logging with warnings

**Result:** More robust error handling prevents UI from breaking when plugins fail to load temporarily.

## Testing the Fixes

### Step 1: Verify Fixes Are Applied
```bash
python check_fixes.py
```
You should see "PASS" for all checks.

### Step 2: Start the Server
```bash
cd C:\Ambiance2\ambiance
python -m ambiance.server
```

**Important:** You must run the server from the `ambiance` subfolder, not from `C:\Ambiance2`!

### Step 3: Open the Browser
Navigate to: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

### Step 4: Load a Plugin
1. Find the "Plugin Library" section
2. Click on one of your included plugins:
   - `Aspen Trumpet 1.dll` (recommended - likely an instrument)
   - `Harmonical.dll`
   - `scrooo.vst3`
   - `scrooo64.dll`
3. Click "‚¨ÜÔ∏è Load Selected"

### Step 5: Look for the Keyboard
After loading, you should see:
- **"Digital Instrument" panel** expands (was hidden before)
- **On-screen keyboard** with white and black keys
- **Octave controls** (‚óÄ Oct / Oct ‚ñ∂)
- **Velocity slider**
- **Preview button**

### Step 6: Play and Listen
1. **Make sure your speakers/headphones are on and volume is up!**
2. Click a keyboard key
3. **Listen to your speakers** (not browser)
4. You should hear the plugin's sound

## Troubleshooting

### "The keyboard still doesn't show"

**Check the browser console (F12):**
1. Look for errors from `/api/vst/ui?path=...`
2. Check the network tab for the response

**Verify plugin capabilities:**
1. Navigate to: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/vst/status`
2. Look for:
   ```json
   {
     "capabilities": {
       "midi": true,
       "instrument": true
     }
   }
   ```
3. If both are `false`, the plugin may not support MIDI input

**Check the HTML:**
- The instrument panel has `hidden` attribute when no MIDI plugin is loaded
- Check `renderInstrumentPanel()` is being called (look for console logs)

---

### "I can't hear any audio"

**This is the most common issue!** Follow these steps:

**1. Check Carla Engine Status**
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/vst/status
```
Look for:
```json
{
  "available": true,
  "engine": {
    "running": true,
    "driver": "DirectSound"
  }
}
```

**2. Check System Audio**
- Open Windows Sound Settings
- Verify correct output device is selected
- Test with another app (YouTube, Spotify, etc.)
- Check volume mixer - ensure browser/Python isn't muted

**3. Check MIDI Routing**
In the status response, look for:
```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "midi": true,
    "midi_routed": true
  }
}
```
If `midi_routed` is `false`, Carla is still connecting MIDI paths (wait a few seconds).

**4. Check Plugin Type**
Not all plugins are instruments! Some are **effects** that need audio input:
```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "instrument": true  // ‚Üê Should be true for synths
  }
}
```

**5. Try Different Audio Driver**
In Python:
```python
from ambiance.integrations.carla_host import CarlaVSTHost
host = CarlaVSTHost()
host.configure_audio(forced_driver="DirectSound")  # or "WASAPI", "Dummy"
```

**6. Check Windows Audio Drivers**
- DirectSound: Most compatible, always available
- WASAPI: Lower latency, requires compatible device
- ASIO: Lowest latency, requires ASIO4ALL or professional audio interface
- Dummy: No audio output (for testing)

## Understanding the Audio Flow

### When You Press a Keyboard Key in the Browser:

```
Browser (Click)
    ‚Üì
JavaScript sends MIDI note-on via /api/vst/midi/note-on
    ‚Üì
Flask server receives request
    ‚Üì
CarlaVSTHost.note_on(60, velocity=0.8)
    ‚Üì
Carla Backend (C++ library)
    ‚Üì
VST Plugin (processes MIDI, generates audio)
    ‚Üì
Carla Audio Engine
    ‚Üì
Windows Audio Driver (DirectSound/WASAPI/ASIO)
    ‚Üì
Your Speakers/Headphones üîä
```

**The browser is NOT involved in the audio path!** It only sends MIDI messages.

---

## Expected Behavior

‚úÖ **Correct:**
- Load plugin ‚Üí Keyboard appears ‚Üí Click key ‚Üí **Hear sound from speakers**
- MIDI events are sent through the browser
- Audio plays through system audio
- No audio in browser's Web Audio API

‚ùå **Incorrect Expectations:**
- Expecting audio to play in the browser
- Expecting browser dev tools to show audio activity
- Expecting Web Audio API to receive audio from Carla

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **The keyboard WILL display** for MIDI-capable plugins (instruments and MIDI effects)

2. **Audio plays through system audio**, not the browser:
   - This is by design
   - This is how professional audio software works (DAWs, plugin hosts)
   - This provides lowest latency and best quality

3. **Check your speakers first!**
   - Most "no audio" issues are muted speakers or wrong output device
   - Test with another application first

4. **The "Preview" button is for future use**
   - Will render offline audio and send to browser
   - Different from real-time keyboard playback

## Developer Notes

### MIDI Capability Detection Flow

```python
# In load_plugin():
self._supports_midi = self._plugin_accepts_midi()  # Line 1473

# In _build_descriptor():
accepts_midi = self._plugin_accepts_midi()         # Line 1756
supports_midi = self._supports_midi or accepts_midi # Line 1757

# This ensures MIDI capability is detected even during temporary loads
```

### Why the Fallback?

When `describe_ui()` temporarily loads a plugin:
1. State is snapshotted before load
2. Plugin is loaded temporarily
3. Descriptor is built
4. State is restored

During step 3, `self._supports_midi` might be from the old state, so we explicitly check again with `_plugin_accepts_midi()`.
