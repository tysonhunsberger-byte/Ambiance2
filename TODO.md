- Integrate Strudel-style pattern language into audio engine (parser, scheduler, UI).  See `docs/strudel_integration.md` for current build and embedding steps.
- Prototype SuperCollider bridge so tone/noise controls can drive external synthdefs via OSC.
- Keep `docs/synthesis_getting_started.md` up to date with beginner-friendly progress notes.
