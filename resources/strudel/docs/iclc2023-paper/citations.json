  {"id":"aaronPrincipledApproachDeveloping2011","abstract":"This paper introduces Improcess, a novel cross-disciplinary collaborative project focussed on the design and development of tools to structure the communication between performer and musical process. We describe a 3-tiered architecture centering around the notion of a Common Music Runtime, a shared platform on top of which inter-operating client interfaces may be combined to form new musical instruments. This approach allows hardware devices such as the monome to act as an extended hardware interface with the same power to initiate and control musical processes as a bespoke programming language. Finally, we reflect on the structure of the collaborative project itself, which of- fers an opportunity to discuss general research strategy for conducting highly sophisticated technical research within a performing arts environment such as the development of a personal regime of preparation for performance.","author":[{"family":"Aaron","given":"Samuel"},{"family":"Blackwell","given":"Alan F."},{"family":"Hoadley","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Regan","given":"Tim"}],"citation-key":"aaronPrincipledApproachDeveloping2011","container-title":"Proceedings of New Interfaces for Musical Expression 2011","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"page":"381–386","title":"A principled approach to developing new languages for live coding","type":"paper-conference"},
  {"id":"abdullahImpactAgileMethodology2006","abstract":"This paper describes an empirical study, which addresses the aspect of well being amongst members of the software development teams. The question of interest is whether an agile methodology has any distinct effect on the well being of the software developers. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were utilised, including the participative observation, focus group interviews, close-ended questionnaires and simple statistical tests such as Spearman Correlation and Mann—Whitney test. Initial results showed that an agile methodology (XP) has a positive effect on the level of enthusiasm of the software developers in the most dynamic project. To understand why XP can increase enthusiasm, results are interpreted with references to cognitive, affective and managerial properties of the practices studied. This result needs further investigation on the individual effects of each practice on the wellbeing and attitudes of Software Engineering (SE) teams.","author":[{"family":"Abdullah","given":"Sharifah S."},{"family":"Holcombe","given":"Mike"},{"family":"Gheorge","given":"Marian"}],"citation-key":"abdullahImpactAgileMethodology2006","container-title":"Empirical Softw.

The text asks the broad question \"What is programming?\" Having come to the conclusion that programming consists of procedures and data, the authors set off to explore the related questions of \"What is data?\" and \"What is a procedure?\"<P> The authors build up the simple notion of a procedure to dizzying complexity. The discussion culminates in the description of the code behind the programming language Scheme.

Timbrally distinct, asymmetrical in structure, and aurally prominent, time lines have drawn comment from scholars as keys to understanding African rhythm.

Observations about structure (including its internal dynamic, metrical potential, and rotational properties) are juxtaposed with a putative African-cultural understanding (inferred from the firm place of dance in the culture, patterns of verbal discourse, and a broad set of social values) in order to further illuminate the nature of African rhythm, foster dialogue between structural and cultural perspectives, and thereby contribute implicitly to the methodology of cross-cultural analysis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Agawu","given":"Kofi"}],"citation-key":"agawuStructuralAnalysisCultural2006","container-title":"Journal of the American Musicological Society","container-title-short":"Journal of the American Musicological Society","DOI":"10.1525/jams.2006.59.1.1","ISSN":"0003-0139","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1-46","publisher":"University of California Press","source":"online.ucpress.edu","title":"Structural Analysis or Cultural Analysis?

First published in 1965, On Weaving bridges the transition between handcraft and the machine-made, highlighting the essential importance of material awareness and the creative leaps that can occur when design problems are tackled by hand.With her focus on materials and handlooms, Anni Albers discusses how technology and mass production place limits on creativity and problem solving, and makes the case for a renewed embrace of human ingenuity that is particularly important today. Her lucid and engaging prose is illustrated with a wealth of rare and extraordinary images showing the history of the medium, from hand-drawn diagrams and close-ups of pre-Columbian textiles to material studies with corn, paper, and the typewriter, as well as illuminating examples of her own work.Now available for a new generation of readers, this expanded edition of On Weaving updates the book’s original black-and-white illustrations with full-color photos, and features an afterword by Nicholas Fox Weber and essays by Manuel Cirauqui and T’ai Smith that shed critical light on Albers and her career.","author":[{"family":"Albers","given":"Anni"}],"citation-key":"albersWeavingNewExpanded2017","ISBN":"978-1-4008-8904-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,24]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"273","publisher":"Princeton University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"On Weaving: New Expanded Edition","title-short":"On Weaving","type":"book"},

  {"id":"allenGettingThingsDone2002","abstract":"With first-chapter allusions to martial arts, \"flow,\" \"mind like water,\" and other concepts borrowed from the East (and usually mangled), you'd almost think this self-helper from David Allen should have been called <I>Zen and the Art of Schedule Maintenance</I>.<p> Not quite. Yes, <I>Getting Things Done</I> offers a complete system for downloading all those free-floating gotta-do's clogging your brain into a sophisticated framework of files and action lists–all purportedly to free your mind to focus on whatever you're working on. However, it still operates from the decidedly Western notion that if we could just get really, really organized, we could turn ourselves into 24/7 productivity machines. (To wit, Allen, whom the New Economy bible <I>Fast Company</I> has dubbed \"the personal productivity guru,\" suggests that instead of meditating on crouching tigers and hidden dragons while you wait for a plane, you should unsheathe that high-tech saber known as the cell phone and attack that list of calls you need to return.)<p> As whole-life-organizing systems go, Allen's is pretty good, even fun and therapeutic. It starts with the exhortation to take every unaccounted-for scrap of paper in your workstation that you can't junk, The next step is to write down every unaccounted-for gotta-do cramming your head onto its own scrap of paper. Finally, throw the whole stew into a giant \"in-basket\" <p> That's where the processing and prioritizing begin; in Allen's system, it get a little convoluted at times, rife as it is with fancy terms, subterms, and sub-subterms for even the simplest concepts. Thank goodness the spine of his system is captured on a straightforward, one-page flowchart that you can pin over your desk and repeatedly consult without having to refer back to the book. That alone is worth the purchase price. Also of value is Allen's ingenious Two-Minute Rule: if there's anything you absolutely must do that you can do right now in two minutes or less, then do it now, thus freeing up your time and mind tenfold over the long term. It's commonsense advice so obvious that most of us completely overlook it, much to our detriment; Allen excels at dispensing such wisdom in this useful, if somewhat belabored, self-improver aimed at everyone from CEOs to soccer moms (who we all know are more organized than most CEOs to start with). –<I>Timothy Murphy</I> <P> <B>In today's world of exponentially increased communication and responsibility, yesterday's methods for staying on top just don't work.</B> <P> Veteran management consultant and trainer David Allen recognizes that \"time management\" is useless the minute your schedule is interrupted; \"setting priorities\" isn't relevant when your email is down; \"procrastination solutions\" won't help if your goals aren't clear. <P> Allen's premise is simple: our ability to be productive is directly proportional to our ability to relax. Only when our minds are clear and our thoughts are organized can we achieve stress-free productivity and unleash our creative potential. He teaches us how to: <P> <UL TYPE=CIRCLE> <LI>Apply the \"do it, delegate it, defer it, drop it\" rule to get your in-box empty<BR> <LI>Reassess goals and stay focused in changing situations<BR> <LI>Overcome feelings of confusion, anxiety, and being overwhelmed<BR> <LI>Feel fine about what you're not doing<BR> </UL> <P> From core principles to proven tricks, <I>Getting Things Done</I> has the potential to transform the way you work – and the way you experience work. At any level of implementation, David Allen's entertaining and thought-provoking advice shows you how to pick up the pace without wearing yourself down. \"\"\"The personal productivity guru\"\" (Fast Company) delivers powerful methods that vastly increase your efficiency and creative results-at work and in life In today's world, yesterday's methods just don't work.

  {"id":"antoniolAnalyzingCloningEvolution2002","abstract":"Identifying code duplication in large multi-platform software systems is a challenging problem. This is due to a variety of reasons including the presence of high-level programming languages and structures interleaved with hardware-dependent low-level resources and assembler code, the use of GUI-based configuration scripts generating commands to compile the system, and the extremely high number of possible different configurations. This paper studies the extent and the evolution of code duplications in the Linux kernel. Linux is a large, multi-platform software system; it is based on the Open Source concept, and so there are no obstacles in discussing its implementation. In addition, it is decidedly too large to be examined manually: the current Linux kernel release (2.4.18) is about three million LOCs. Nineteen releases, from 2.4.0 to 2.4.18, were processed and analyzed, identifying code duplication among Linux subsystems by means of a metric-based approach. The obtained results support the hypothesis that the Linux system does not contain a relevant fraction of code duplication. Furthermore, code duplication tends to remain stable across releases, thus suggesting a fairly stable structure, evolving smoothly without any evidence of degradation.","author":[{"family":"Antoniol","given":"G."}],"citation-key":"antoniolAnalyzingCloningEvolution2002","container-title":"Information and Software Technology","DOI":"10.1016/s0950-5849(02)00123-4","ISSN":"09505849","issue":"13","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002,10]]},"page":"755–765","title":"Analyzing cloning evolution in the Linux kernel","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0950-5849(02)00123-4","volume":"44"},

Previous research has not taken account of the possibility that deaf people will show greater heterogeneity in how they experience voice-hallucinations due to individual differences in experience with language and residual hearing. This study aims to explore how deaf participants perceive voice-hallucinations and whether the perceptual characteristics reported reflect individual experience with language and sensory input. <i>Method</i>. A statement-sorting task generated data about perceptual characteristics of voice-hallucinations for exploratory factor analysis. The sample included 27 deaf participants with experience of voice-hallucinations, and a range of hearing loss and language backgrounds. <i>Results</i>. Perceptual characteristics of voice-hallucinations map closely onto individual auditory experience. People born profoundly deaf loaded onto nonauditory factors. Deaf people with experience of hearing speech, through residual hearing, hearing aids, or predeafness experience, reported auditory features or uncertainty about mode of perception. <i>Conclusions</i>.

This model represents the timbre of a texture as the long-term distribution of its local spectral features. The underlying assumption is rarely made explicit: the perception of the timbre of a texture is assumed to result from the most statistically significant feature windows. This thesis questions the validity of this assumption. To do so, we construct an explicit measure of the timbre similarity between polyphonic music textures, and variants thereof inspired by previous work in Music Information Retrieval. We show that the precision of such measures is bounded, and that the remaining error rate is not incidental. Notably, this class of algorithms tends to create false positives - which we call hubs - which are mostly always the same songs regardless of the query. Their study shows that the perceptual saliency of feature observations is not necessarily correlated with their statistical significance with respect to the global distribution. In other words, music listeners routinely \"hear\" things that are not statistically significant in musical signals, but rather are the result of high-level cognitive reasoning, which depends on cultural expectations, a priori knowledge, and context. Much of the music we hear as being \"piano music\" is really music that we expect to be piano music. Such statistical/perceptual paradoxes are instrumental in the observed discrepancy between human perception of timbre and the models studied here.","author":[{"family":"Aucouturier","given":"Jean J."}],"citation-key":"aucouturierTenExperimentsModelling2006","event-place":"Paris, France","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006]]},"publisher":"University of Paris 6","publisher-place":"Paris, France","title":"Ten Experiments on the Modelling of Polyphonic Timbre","type":"thesis","URL":"http://www.jj-aucouturier.info/papers/PHD-2006.pdf"},

For comparison the performance of non-synaesthetic control subjects was also assessed. There was a relationship between the modality of synaesthetic experience and the modality of sensory enhancement.

In work presented here, we used a well-known multisensory illusion called the McGurk effect to show that synaesthesia is driven by late, perceptual processing, rather than early, unisensory processing. Specifically, we tested 9 linguistic-color synaesthetes and found that the colors induced by spoken words are related to what is perceived (i.e., the illusory combination of audio and visual inputs) and not to the auditory component alone.

  {"id":"barsalouGroundedCognitionPresent2010","abstract":"Abstract Thirty years ago, grounded cognition had roots in philosophy, perception, cognitive linguistics, psycholinguistics, cognitive psychology, and cognitive neuropsychology. During the next 20 years, grounded cognition continued developing in these areas, and it also took new forms in robotics, cognitive ecology, cognitive neuroscience, and developmental psychology. In the past 10 years, research on grounded cognition has grown rapidly, especially in cognitive neuroscience, social neuroscience, cognitive psychology, social psychology, and developmental psychology. Currently, grounded cognition appears to be achieving increased acceptance throughout cognitive science, shifting from relatively minor status to increasing importance. Nevertheless, researchers wonder whether grounded mechanisms lie at the heart of the cognitive system or are peripheral to classic symbolic mechanisms. Although grounded cognition is currently dominated by demonstration experiments in the absence of well-developed theories, the area is likely to become increasingly theory driven over the next 30 years. Another likely development is the increased incorporation of grounding mechanisms into cognitive architectures and into accounts of classic cognitive phenomena. As this incorporation occurs, much functionality of these architectures and phenomena is likely to remain, along with many original mechanisms. Future theories of grounded cognition are likely to be heavily influenced by both cognitive neuroscience and social neuroscience, and also by developmental science and robotics. Aspects from the three major perspectives in cognitive science—classic symbolic architectures, statistical/dynamical systems, and grounded cognition—will probably be integrated increasingly in future theories, each capturing indispensable aspects of intelligence.","author":[{"family":"Barsalou","given":"Lawrence W."}],"citation-key":"barsalouGroundedCognitionPresent2010","container-title":"Topics in Cognitive Science","DOI":"10.1111/j.1756-8765.2010.01115.x","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"page":"716–724","title":"Grounded Cognition: Past, Present, and Future","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2010.01115.x","volume":"2"},

  {"id":"barsalouPerceptualSymbolSystems1999","abstract":"Prior to the twentieth century, theories of knowledge were inherently perceptual. Since then, developments in logic, statistics, and programming languages have inspired amodal theories that rest on principles fundamentally different from those underlying perception. In addition, perceptual approaches have become widely viewed as untenable because they are assumed to implement recording systems, not conceptual systems. A perceptual theory of knowledge is developed here in the context of current cognitive science and neuroscience. During perceptual experience, association areas in the brain capture bottom-up patterns of activation in sensory-motor areas. Later, in a top-down manner, association areas partially reactivate sensory-motor areas to implement perceptual symbols. The storage and reactivation of perceptual symbols operates at the level of perceptual components–not at the level of holistic perceptual experiences. Through the use of selective attention, schematic representations of perceptual components are extracted from experience and stored in memory (e.g., individual memories of green, purr, hot). As memories of the same component become organized around a common frame, they implement a simulator that produces limitless simulations of the component (e.g., simulations of purr). Not only do such simulators develop for aspects of sensory experience, they also develop for aspects of proprioception (e.g., lift, run) and introspection (e.g., compare, memory, happy, hungry). Once established, these simulators implement a basic conceptual system that represents types, supports categorization, and produces categorical inferences. These simulators further support productivity, propositions, and abstract concepts, thereby implementing a fully functional conceptual system. Productivity results from integrating simulators combinatorially and recursively to produce complex simulations. Propositions result from binding simulators to perceived individuals to represent type-token relations. Abstract concepts are grounded in complex simulations of combined physical and introspective events. Thus, a perceptual theory of knowledge can implement a fully functional conceptual system while avoiding problems associated with amodal symbol systems. Implications for cognition, neuroscience, evolution, development, and artificial intelligence are explored.","author":[{"family":"Barsalou","given":"L.

Further evidence suggests that simulation is typically situated, with the situated character of experience in the environment being reflected in the situated character of the representations that underlie simulation. A basic architecture is sketched of how the brain implements situated simulation. Within this framework, simulators implement the concepts that underlie knowledge, and situated conceptualizations capture patterns of multi-modal simulation associated with frequently experienced situations. A pattern completion inference mechanism uses current perception to activate situated conceptualizations that produce predictions via simulations on relevant modalities.

  {"id":"bartonEthnomathematicsExploringCultural1996","abstract":"This thesis provides a new conceptualisation of ethnomathematics which avoids some of the difficulties which emerge in the literature. In particular, work has been started on a philosophic basis for the field. There is no consistent view of ethnomathematics in the literature. The relationship with mathematics itself has been ignored, and the philosophical and theoretical background is missing. The literature also reveals the ethnocentricity implied by ethnomathematics as a field of study based in a culture which has mathematics as a knowledge category. Two strategies to over come this problem are identified: universalising the referent of ‘mathematics’ so that it is the same as “knowledge-making”; or using methodological techniques to minimise it. The position of ethnomathematics in relationship to anthropology, sociology, history, and politics is characterised on a matrix. A place for ethnomathematics is found close the anthropology of mathematics, but the aim of anthropology is to better understand culture in general, while ethnomathematics aims to better understand mathematics. Anthropology, however, contributes its well-established methodologies for overcoming ethnocentricity. The search for a philosophical base finds a Wittgensteinian orientation which enables culturally based ‘systems of meaning’ to gain credibility in mathematics. A definition is proposed for ethnomathematics as the study of mathematical practices within context. Four types of ethnomathematical activity are identified: descriptive, archaeological, mathematising, and analytical activity. The definition also gives rise to a categorisation of ethnomathematical work along three dimensions: the closeness to conventional mathematics; the historical time; and the type of host culture. The mechanisms of interaction between mathematical practices are identified, and the imperialistic growth of mathematics is explained. Particular features of ethnomathematical theory are brought out in a four examples. By admitting the legitimacy of other viewpoints, ethnomathematics opens mathematics to new creative forces. Within education, ethnomathematics provides new choices, and turns cultural conflict into a useful tool for teaching. Mathematical activity exists in a variety of contexts. Learning mathematics involves being aware of, and integrating, diverse concepts. Ethnomathematics expands mathematical horizons, so that cultural diversity becomes a richer contributor to the cultural structures which humans use to understand their world.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Barton","given":"Bill"}],"citation-key":"bartonEthnomathematicsExploringCultural1996","genre":"Thesis","issued":{"date-parts":[[1996]]},"language":"en","publisher":"ResearchSpace@Auckland","source":"researchspace.auckland.ac.nz","title":"Ethnomathematics: Exploring Cultural Diversity in Mathematics","title-short":"Ethnomathematics","type":"thesis","URL":"https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/handle/2292/2332"},

  {"id":"bellingerPerceptionTimeMusic2017","abstract":"Objective: Perception of time as well as rhythm in musical structures rely on complex brain mechanisms and require an extended network of multiple neural sources. They are therefore sensitive to impairment. Several psychophysical studies have shown that patients with Parkinson´s disease (PD) have deficits in perceiving time and rhythms due to a malfunction of the basal ganglia (BG) network. Method: In this study we investigated the time perception of PD patients during music perception by assessing their just noticeable difference (JND) in the time perception of a complex musical Gestalt. We applied a temporal discrimination task using a short melody with a clear beat-based rhythm. Among the subjects, 26 patients under L-Dopa administration and 21 age-matched controls had to detect an artificially delayed time interval in the range between 80 and 300 milliseconds in the middle of the musical period. We analyzed the data by a) calculating the detection threshold directly, b) by extrapolating the JNDs, c.) relating it to musical expertise. Results: Patients differed from controls in the detection of time-intervals between 220-300ms (*p = 0.0200, n = 47). Furthermore, this deficit depended on the severity of the disease (*p = 0.0452; n = 47). Surprisingly, PD patients did not show any deficit of their JND compared to healthy controls, although the results showed a trend (*p = 0.0565, n = 40). Furthermore, no significant difference of the JND was found according to the severity of the disease. Additionally, musically trained persons seemed to have lower thresholds in detecting deviations in time and syntactic structures of music (*p = 0.0343, n = 39). Conclusion: As an explanation of these results, we would like to propose the hypothesis of a time-syntax-congruency in music perception suggesting that processing of time and rhythm is a Gestalt process and that cortical areas involved in processing of musical syntax may compensate for impaired BG circuits that are responsible for time processing and rhythm perception. This mechanism may emerge more strongly as the deficits in time processing and rhythm perception progress. Furthermore, we presume that top-down-bottom-up-processes interfere additionally and interact in this context of compensation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,8,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Bellinger","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Altenmüller","given":"Eckart"},{"family":"Volkmann","given":"Jens"}],"citation-key":"bellingerPerceptionTimeMusic2017","container-title":"Frontiers in Neuroscience","container-title-short":"Front.

  {"id":"beyerAnimatedVisualizationSoftware2006","abstract":"The understanding of the structure of a software system can be improved by analyzing the system's evolution during development. Visualizations of software history that provide only static views do not capture the dynamic nature of software evolution. We present a new visualization technique, the Evolution Storyboard, which provides dynamic views of the evolution of a software's structure. An evolution storyboard consists of a sequence of animated panels, which highlight the structural changes in the system; one panel for each considered time period. Using storyboards, engineers can spot good design, signs of structural decay, or the spread of cross cutting concerns in the code. We implemented our concepts in a tool, which automatically extracts software dependency graphs from version control repositories and computes storyboards based on panels for different time periods. For applying our approach in practice, we provide a step by step guide that others can follow along the storyboard visualizations, in order to study the evolution of large systems. We have applied our method to several large open source software systems. In this paper, we demonstrate that our method provides additional information (compared to static views) on the ArgoUML project, an open source UML modeling tool.","author":[{"family":"Beyer","given":"Dirk"},{"family":"Hassan","given":"Ahmed E."}],"citation-key":"beyerAnimatedVisualizationSoftware2006","container-title":"Proceedings of the 13th Working Conference on Reverse Engineering","DOI":"10.1109/wcre.2006.14","event-place":"Washington, DC, USA","ISBN":"0-7695-2719-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006]]},"page":"199–210","publisher":"IEEE Computer Society","publisher-place":"Washington, DC, USA","title":"Animated Visualization of Software History using Evolution Storyboards","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/wcre.2006.14"},

  {"id":"birdPromisesPerilsMining2009","abstract":"We are now witnessing the rapid growth of decentralized source code management (DSCM) systems, in which every developer has her own repository. DSCMs facilitate a style of collaboration in which work output can flow sideways (and privately) between collaborators, rather than always up and down (and publicly) via a central repository. Decentralization comes with both the promise of new data and the peril of its misinterpretation. We focus on git, a very popular DSCM used in high-profile projects. Decentralization, and other features of git, such as automatically recorded contributor attribution, lead to richer content histories, giving rise to new questions such as ” How do contributions flow between developers to the official project repository?” However, there are pitfalls. Commits may be reordered, deleted, or edited as they move between repositories. The semantics of terms common to SCMs and DSCMs sometimes differ markedly, potentially creating confusion. For example, a commit is immediately visible to all developers in centralized SCMs, but not in DSCMs. Our goal is to help researchers interested in DSCMs avoid these and other perils when mining and analyzing git data.","author":[{"family":"Bird","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Rigby","given":"Peter C."},{"family":"Barr","given":"Earl T."},{"family":"Hamilton","given":"David J."},{"family":"German","given":"Daniel M."},{"family":"Devanbu","given":"Prem"}],"citation-key":"birdPromisesPerilsMining2009","collection-title":"MSR '09","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2009 6th IEEE International Working Conference on Mining Software Repositories","DOI":"10.1109/msr.2009.5069475","event-place":"Washington, DC, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4244-3493-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"page":"1–10","publisher":"IEEE Computer Society","publisher-place":"Washington, DC, USA","title":"The promises and perils of mining git","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/msr.2009.5069475","volume":"0"},

A corpus analysis of the standard Java documentation revealed the range of conceptual metaphors shared by library authors and users of packages such as java.util and java.bean.

More surprisingly, program components are metaphorically understood as actors with beliefs and intentions, working together according to social relationships. Rather than mechanical imperative models or mathematical declarative ones, it seems that one of the most widespread bases for conceptual models of programming is of social entities that act as proxies for their developers.

  {"id":"blackwellSeeWhatYou2001","abstract":"It has been argued that most end-users would not want to write programs, no matter what kind of tools they had to help them. This paper analyzes the reasons for that situation, and addresses them with a new approach to programming. There is a large class of users who are very reluctant to create any kind of abstraction within a computer (they will not create a new directory, let alone a Word macro). But these people do create abstractions in their everyday lives outside the computer. The reason for their computer habits can be explained in terms of a simple investment and risk model. See What You Need (SWYN) is a system intended to deliver the capabilities—not just of Word macros, but of Perl—to end-users. The techniques it adopts are those of programming by example, visual program representation and direct manipulation. SWYN is not intended to be a complete system, and is unlikely to develop into a complete Perl replacement. It is a research vehicle, supporting the evaluation of specific features aimed at reducing the perceived risk of abstraction in programming. This paper describes two elements of the SWYN project, both of them related to the regular expressions that are central to pattern matching in Perl. The first is a prototype system that acquires regular expressions from the type of examples required in direct manipulation of data for programming. The second is an experimental evaluation of alternative notations for visualizing regular expressions. This experiment demonstrated a clear advantage for graphical notations in typical end-user tasks, both over conventional regular expressions, and over a tutorial-style textual notation. The overall effect is a reduction both in programming investment and in perceived risk.","author":[{"family":"Blackwell","given":"A."}],"citation-key":"blackwellSeeWhatYou2001","container-title":"Journal of Visual Languages & Computing","DOI":"10.1006/jvlc.2001.0216","ISSN":"1045926X","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2001,10]]},"page":"475–499","title":"See What You Need: Helping End-users to Build Abstractions","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/jvlc.2001.0216","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"boerModellingVocalAnatomy2010","abstract":"This paper investigates the effect of larynx position on the articulatory abilities of a human-like vocal tract. Previous work has investigated models that were built to resemble the anatomy of existing species or fossil ancestors. This has led to conflicting conclusions about the relation between the evolution of anatomy and the evolution of speech. Here a model is proposed to systematically investigate the relation between larynx height and articulatory abilities. It is a simplified model of primate vocal anatomy that nevertheless preserves the essential articulatory constraints due to limitations of muscular control. It is found that there is an optimal larynx height at which the largest range of signals can be produced and that at this height, the vertical and horizontal parts are approximately equally long. This has been a conjecture for a long time by those researchers of the evolution of speech who propose that the human vocal tract has evolved for speech. A short recapitulation of acoustic theory of speech production is presented to explain the reason for why this configuration is optimal.The optimal configuration corresponds closely to human female anatomy, while in the human male the larynx is slightly lower than optimal. These results agree with the hypothesis that modern human vocal anatomy has evolved because of speech, and that male larynx position might have been lowered further for reasons of size exaggeration.","author":[{"family":"Boer","given":"Bart"}],"citation-key":"boerModellingVocalAnatomy2010","container-title":"Journal of Evolutionary Psychology","DOI":"10.1556/jep.8.2010.4.1","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,12]]},"page":"351–366","title":"Modelling vocal anatomy's significant effect on speech","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1556/jep.8.2010.4.1","volume":"8"},
  {"id":"bolgerMultidimensionalTimbreAnalysis2005","abstract":"A method of analysing timbre in melody that takes account of its multidimensional characteristic is described. The aim of this analysis technique is to uncover the role of timbre as a structural element in melody. Gaining an understanding of how an abstract, multidimensional sound phenomenon such as timbre is used in a structured manner can lead to important insights into potential cognitive abilities; our ability to form mental representations of abstract phenomena so that they can be conserved and, subsequently, used in an organised or structured manner. This method of analysis comprises two main components, a first which carries out a time-frequency analysis of the melodic signal and processes the signal data using DSP techniques that model aspects of auditory processing before calculating the timbre descriptors, and a second that represents the melody in terms of its timbral changes rather than its absolute timbral values. A self-organising feature map is used to reduce the timbral detail and the dimensionality of the timbral representation, and to contrast-enhance the timbral changes. An example of the implementation of this analysis technique is presented using an extract from a Japanese shakuhachi honkyoku melody, chosen because of its accepted exploitation of timbre.","author":[{"family":"Bolger","given":"Deirdre"},{"family":"Griffith","given":"Niall"}],"citation-key":"bolgerMultidimensionalTimbreAnalysis2005","container-title":"Proceedings of the Conference on Interdisciplinary Musicology 2005","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005]]},"title":"Multidimensional timbre analysis of shakuhachi honkyoku","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"borgModernMultidimensionalScaling2005","abstract":"The book provides a comprehensive treatment of multidimensional scaling (MDS), a family of statistical techniques for analyzing the structure of (dis)similarity data. Such data are widespread, including, for example, intercorrelations of survey items, direct ratings on the similarity on choice objects, or trade indices for a set of countries. MDS represents the data as distances among points in a geometric space of low dimensionality. This map can help to see patterns in the data that are not obvious from the data matrices. MDS is also used as a psychological model for judgments of similarity and preference. This book may be used as an introduction to MDS for students in psychology, sociology, and marketing. The prerequisite is an elementary background in statistics. The book is also well suited for a variety of advanced courses on MDS topics. All the mathematics required for more advanced topics is developed systematically. This second edition is not only a complete overhaul of its predecessor, but also adds some 140 pages of new material. Many chapters are revised or have sections reflecting new insights and developments in MDS. There are two new chapters, one on asymmetric models and the other on unfolding. There are also numerous exercises that help the reader to practice what he or she has learned, and to delve deeper into the models and its intricacies. These exercises make it easier to use this edition in a course. All data sets used in the book can be downloaded from the web. The appendix on computer programs has also been updated and enlarged to reflect the state of the art.","author":[{"family":"Borg","given":"I."},{"family":"Groenen","given":"P. J.

In this paper we explore how conceptual visualizations (such as diagrams, visual metaphors, charts, sketches) can be constructed and used as cognitive artefacts that support collaborative knowledge work. In order to facilitate tasks such as the creation and sharing of knowledge in teams, we propose a collaborative dimensions framework as a tool for understanding how visual artefacts can facilitate collaboration in circumstances that involve distributed knowledge. The framework is based on the widespread Cognitive Dimensions of Notation framework and is enriched with criteria from the boundary object paradigm discussed in organization science. The dimensions of the framework are described and then applied to three different visualizations that are used in collaborative knowledge work.

He concluded that scientists were either totally lacking in visual imagery or had ” feeble” powers of mental imagery. This finding has been widely accepted in the secondary literature in psychology. A replication of Galton's study with modern scientists and modern university undergraduates found no scientists totally lacking in visual imagery and very few with feeble visual imagery. Examination of Galton's published data shows that his own published data do not support his claims about deficient visual imagery in scientists. The modern data for scientists and nonscientists and the 1880 data for scientists and nonscientists are in agreement in showing that all groups report substantial imagery on recollective memory tasks such as Galton's breakfast questionnaire. We conclude that Galton's conclusions were an example of theory-laden interpretation of data based on the initial responses from several very salient scientists who reported little or no visual imagery on Galton's imagery questionnaire.","author":[{"family":"Brewer","given":"William F."},{"family":"Schommer-Aikins","given":"Marlene"}],"citation-key":"brewerScientistsAreNot2006","container-title":"Review of General Psychology","DOI":"10.1037/1089-2680.10.2.130","ISSN":"1089-2680","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006]]},"page":"130–146","title":"Scientists Are Not Deficient in Mental Imagery: Galton Revised.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/1089-2680.10.2.130","volume":"10"},

One reason is that computers communicate solely by graphical output. This paper suggests the use of non-speech sound output to enhance the graphical display of information to overcome overload. The question is how to integrate the display of sound and graphics to capitalise on the advantages each offers. The approach described here is to integrate sound into the basic components of the human-computer interface. Two experiments are described where non-speech sounds were added to buttons and scrollbars. Results showed sound improved usability by increasing performance and reducing time to recover from errors. Subjective workload measures also showed a significant reduction. Results from this work show that the integrated display of graphical and auditory information can overcome information overload. \\copyright 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.","author":[{"family":"Brewster","given":"S.

  {"id":"brezineAlgorithmsAutomationProduction2011","abstract":"This Handbook explores the history of mathematics under a series of themes which raise new questions about what mathematics has been and what it has meant to practice it. It addresses questions of who creates mathematics, who uses it, and how. A broader understanding of mathematical practitioners naturally leads to a new appreciation of what counts as a historical source. Material and oral evidence is drawn upon as well as an unusual array of textual sources. Further, the ways in which people have chosen to express themselves are as historically meaningful as the contents of the mathematics they have produced. Mathematics is not a fixed and unchanging entity. New questions, contexts, and applications all influence what counts as productive ways of thinking. Because the history of mathematics should interact constructively with other ways of studying the past, the contributors to this book come from a diverse range of intellectual backgrounds in anthropology, archaeology, art history, philosophy, and literature, as well as history of mathematics more traditionally understood.The thirty-six self-contained, multifaceted chapters, each written by a specialist, are arranged under three main headings: 'Geographies and Cultures', 'Peoples and Practices', and 'Interactions and Interpretations'. Together they deal with the mathematics of 5000 years, but without privileging the past three centuries, and an impressive range of periods and places with many points of cross-reference between chapters. The key mathematical cultures of North America, Europe, the Middle East, India, and China are all represented here as well as areas which are not often treated in mainstream history of mathematics, such as Russia, the Balkans, Vietnam, and South America. This Handbook will be a vital reference for graduates and researchers in mathematics, historians of science, and general historians.","author":[{"family":"Brezine","given":"Carrie"}],"citation-key":"brezineAlgorithmsAutomationProduction2011","collection-title":"Oxford Handbooks","container-title":"The Oxford Handbook of the History of Mathematics","editor":[{"family":"Robson","given":"E"},{"family":"Stedall","given":"J"}],"event-place":"Oxford, New York","ISBN":"978-0-19-960319-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,4,1]]},"page":"468-492","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher-place":"Oxford, New York","source":"Oxford University Press","title":"Algorithms and automation: the production of mathematics and textiles","type":"chapter"},
  {"id":"brezinecarrieCreatingSymmetryLoom2004","abstract":"This is the companion volume to the authors' groundbreaking Symmetries of Culture, the classic reference for symmetry analysis of pattern for anthropologists, archaeologists, art historians, mathematicians, and designers. Central to symmetry analysis is the use of symmetry in the more precise sense of its geometrical isometries in contrast to its everyday meaning of balance. For this volume, Donald Crowe and Dorothy Washburn invited colleagues from several disciplines to apply the method of symmetry analysis to actual case studies from cultures around the world. The essays compiled here explore how cultural information is embedded in the symmetrical structure of pattern. From descriptions of patterns on objects as diverse as Nasca embroideries, Ica Valley ceramics, Quechua textiles, Yombe mats, and Zulu beadwork, as well as from Amazonian shamanic therapy, ceramic design among the Shipibo, and Turkish Yörük weaving, the contributors reveal how the symmetrical structures in the patterns describe aspects of each culture's fundamental principles for living in the world. This approach offers a profoundly fresh way to read the meaning in pattern by arguing that pattern communicates through the structural metaphors embedded in the symmetrical relationship of the pattern parts. The two volumes together offer readers a revolutionary new window into the communicative importance of design.","author":[{"family":"Brezine, Carrie","given":""}],"citation-key":"brezinecarrieCreatingSymmetryLoom2004","container-title":"Symmetry Comes of Age: The Role of Pattern in Culture","editor":[{"family":"Washburn","given":"Dorothy Koster"},{"family":"Crowe","given":"Donald Warren"}],"ISBN":"978-0-295-98366-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004]]},"language":"en","page":"65-80","publisher":"University of Washington Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Creating Symmetry on the Loom","type":"chapter"},

Our news feeds are filled with unverified, unverifiable speculation, much of it automatically generated by anonymous software. As a result, we no longer understand what is happening around us. Underlying all of these trends is a single idea: the belief that quantitative data can provide a coherent model of the world, and the efficacy of computable information to provide us with ways of acting within it. Yet the sheer volume of information available to us today reveals less than we hope. Rather, it heralds a new Dark Age: a world of ever-increasing incomprehension. In his brilliant new work, leading artist and writer James Bridle offers us a warning against the future in which the contemporary promise of a new technologically assisted Enlightenment may just deliver its opposite: an age of complex uncertainty, predictive algorithms, surveillance, and the hollowing out of empathy.

  {"id":"buzsakiRhythmsBrain2006","abstract":"Studies of mechanisms in the brain that allow complicated things to happen in a coordinated fashion have produced some of the most spectacular discoveries in neuroscience. This book provides eloquent support for the idea that spontaneous neuron activity, far from being mere noise, is actually the source of our cognitive abilities. It takes a fresh look at the co-evolution of structure and function in the mammalian brain, illustrating how self-emerged oscillatory timing is the brains fundamental organizer of neuronal information. The small world-like connectivity of the cerebral cortex allows for global computation on multiple spatial and temporal scales. The perpetual interactions among the multiple network oscillators keep cortical systems in a highly sensitive metastable state and provide energy-efficient synchronizing mechanisms via weak links. In a sequence of cycles, Gyorgy Buzsaki guides the reader from the physics of oscillations through neuronal assembly organization to complex cognitive processing and memory storage. His clear, fluid writing accessible to any reader with some scientific knowledge is supplemented by extensive footnotes and references that make it just as gratifying and instructive a read for the specialist. The coherent view of a single author who has been at the forefront of research in this exciting field, this volume is essential reading for anyone interested in our rapidly evolving understanding of the brain.","author":[{"family":"Buzsaki","given":"Gyorgy"}],"citation-key":"buzsakiRhythmsBrain2006","edition":"First","ISBN":"0-19-530106-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,8]]},"note":"Published: Hardcover","publisher":"Oxford University Press","title":"Rhythms of the Brain","type":"book","URL":"http://www.worldcat.org/isbn/0195301064"},

Acquired motor skills offer a unique way to test this question, since people differ widely in the actions they have learned to perform. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to study differences in brain activity between watching an action that one has learned to do and an action that one has not, in order to assess whether the brain processes of action observation are modulated by the expertise and motor repertoire of the observer. Experts in classical ballet, experts in capoeira and inexpert control subjects viewed videos of ballet or capoeira actions. Comparing the brain activity when dancers watched their own dance style versus the other style therefore reveals the influence of motor expertise on action observation. We found greater bilateral activations in premotor cortex and intraparietal sulcus, right superior parietal lobe and left posterior superior temporal sulcus when expert dancers viewed movements that they had been trained to perform compared to movements they had not. Our results show that this 'mirror system' integrates observed actions of others with an individual's personal motor repertoire, and suggest that the human brain understands actions by motor simulation.","author":[{"family":"Calvo-Merino","given":"B."},{"family":"Glaser","given":"D.

In two experiments, the ordinal and metrical success of naive listeners was related to length but not to the simple acoustic variables (duration, amplitude, frequency) likely to be related to it.

The algorithm must be capable of being written in a certain language: a language is a set of words written using a defined alphabet. 2. The question that is posed is determined by some given data, called enter, for which the algorithm will be executed. 3. The algorithm is a procedure which is carried out step by step. 4. The action at each step is strictly determined by the algorithm, the entry data and the results obtained at previous steps. 5. The answer, called exit, is clearly specified. 6.

  {"id":"chenOpenSourceChangeLogs2004","abstract":"A recent editorial in Empirical Software Engineering suggested that open-source software projects offer a great deal of data that can be used for experimentation. These data not only include source code, but also artifacts such as defect reports and update logs. A common type of update log that experimenters may wish to investigate is the ChangeLog, which lists changes and the reasons for which they were made. ChangeLog files are created to support the development of software rather than for the needs of researchers, so questions need to be asked about the limitations of using them to support research. This paper presents evidence that the ChangeLog files provided at three open-source web sites were incomplete. We examined at least three ChangeLog files for each of three different open-source software products, namely, GNUJSP, GCC-g++, and Jikes. We developed a method for counting changes that ensures that, as far as possible, each individual ChangeLog entry is treated as a single change. For each ChangeLog file, we compared the actual changes in the source code to the entries in the ChangeLog> file and discovered significant omissions. For example, using our change-counting method, only 35 of the 93 changes in version 1.11 of Jikes appear in the ChangeLog file—that is, over 62% of the changes were not recorded there. The percentage of omissions we found ranged from 3.7 to 78.6%. These are significant omissions that should be taken into account when using ChangeLog files for research. Before using ChangeLog files as a basis for research into the development and maintenance of open-source software, experimenters should carefully check for omissions and inaccuracies.","author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Kai"},{"family":"Schach","given":"Stephen R."},{"family":"Yu","given":"Liguo"},{"family":"Offutt","given":"Jeff"},{"family":"Heller","given":"Gillian Z."}],"citation-key":"chenOpenSourceChangeLogs2004","container-title":"Empirical Softw.

In this paper, we introduce a completely visual representation based on typed Mind Maps to represent steps of calculation for a pure untyped lambda calculator, VLM. This visual representation has serveral advantages over traditional textual and visual calculators. VLM uses typed Mind Maps for both the lambda calculator input and ouput. Although VLM is designed as a computable typed Mind Maps node of our Typed Mind Maps API project [1], it can also be applied to learning and teaching the concepts of lambda calculus as a visualization of traditional textual rewrite steps. Moreover, the lambda calculus queries and the results of queries are both represented as FreeMind files, and that allows them to be organized and deployed easily.

In humans, action observation and action execution engage a network of frontal, parietal, and temporal areas. However, it is unclear whether these responses reflect the activity of a single population that represents both observed and executed actions in a common neural code or the activity of distinct but overlapping populations of exclusively perceptual and motor neurons [3]. Here, we used fMRI adaptation to show that the right inferior parietal lobe (IPL) responds independently to specific actions regardless of whether they are observed or executed. Specifically, responses in the right IPL were attenuated when participants observed a recently executed action relative to one that had not previously been performed. This adaptation across action and perception demonstrates that the right IPL responds selectively to the motoric and perceptual representations of actions and is the first evidence for a neural response in humans that shows both defining properties of mirror neurons.","author":[{"family":"Chong","given":"Trevor T.

  {"id":"choTakelumaExplorationSound2005","abstract":"Modern linguistic theory suggests that the sign is arbitrary, that the relationship between signifier and signified has no discernible pattern. ( ” Dog” could mean cat, and vice versa.) Marketing experts and advertisers, those who create names for new products, think otherwise, that the sounds of words and neologisms can evoke images which elicit an emotional impact. Different sounds can ” feel” sharp or dull, for example; they can give a phenomenological response. Poets, of course, realize that the sounds words make can be used towards expressive means. While morphemes—roots, prefixes and suffixes—have generally been considered the base level of meaning, some studies suggest that phonemes can influence meaning on a subconscious level, perhaps resulting from the physiology of how we produce different sounds in speech. In this paper and accompanying project, I am interested in the relationship between spoken and written language and will look at examples in which meaning plays a integral role in how speech and writing are represented. I will be looking at cases in which the signifier and signified connect in ways Saussure would not have expected. I am especially interested in what might be considered a synaesthetic result: sound and vision are tightly coupled, tied together through meaning. This paper will explore the relationships among issues of sound, writing, meaning, the machine, the line, and the body, by considering previous explorations including invented alphabets, phonetic writing systems, machines for automatic transcription of speech, among others.","author":[{"family":"Cho","given":"Peter"}],"citation-key":"choTakelumaExplorationSound2005","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005]]},"publisher":"University of California, Los Angeles","title":"Takeluma: An Exploration of Sound, Meaning, and Writing","type":"thesis"},

In Supersizing the Mind, Andy Clark argues that our thinking doesn't happen only in our heads but that \"certain forms of human cognizing include inextricable tangles of feedback, feed-forward and feed-around loops: loops that promiscuously criss-cross the boundaries of brain, body and world.\" The pen and paper of Feynman's thought are just such feedback loops, physical machinery that shape the flow of thought and enlarge the boundaries of mind. Drawing upon recent work in psychology, linguistics, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, robotics, human-computer systems, and beyond, Supersizing the Mind offers both a tour of the emerging cognitive landscape and a sustained argument in favor of a conception of mind that is extended rather than \"brain- bound.\" The importance of this new perspective is profound.

Live coding can also be conceived as the performing of ‘thinking-in-action’, a live and embodied navigation of various critical thresholds, affordances and restraints, where its thinking-knowing cannot be easily transmitted nor is it strictly a latent knowledge or ‘know-how’ activated through action. Live coding involves the live negotiation between receptivity and spontaneity, between the embodied and intuitive, between an immersive flow experience and split-attention, between human and machine, the known and not yet known. Moreover, in performing ‘thinking-in-action’, live coding emerges as an experimental site for reflecting on different perceptions and possibilities of temporal experience within live performance: for attending to the threshold between the live and mediated, between present and future–present, proposing even a quality of atemporality or aliveness.","author":[{"family":"Cocker","given":"Emma"}],"citation-key":"cockerPerformingThinkingAction2016","container-title":"International Journal of Performance Arts and Digital Media","DOI":"10.1080/14794713.2016.1227597","ISSN":"1479-4713","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,7,2]]},"page":"102-116","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Performing thinking in action: the meletē of live coding","title-short":"Performing thinking in action","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14794713.2016.1227597","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"cockerWeavingCodesCoding2017","abstract":"Drawing on her experience as “critical interlocutor” within the research project Weaving Codes/Coding Weaves, in this article Emma Cocker reflects on the human qualities of attention, cognitive agility and tactical intelligence activated within live coding and ancient weaving with reference to the Ancient Greek concepts of technē, kairos and mêtis. The article explores how the specificity of “thinking-in-action” cultivated within improvisatory live coding relates to the embodied “thought-in-motion” activated whilst working on the loom. Echoing the wider concerns of Weaving Codes/Coding Weaves, an attempt is made to redefine the relation between weave and code by dislodging the dominant utilitarian histories that connect computer and the loom, instead placing emphasis on the potentially resistant and subversive forms of live thinking-and-knowing cultivated within live coding and ancient weaving. Cocker addresses the Penelopean poetics of both practices, proposing how the combination of kairotic timing and timeliness with the mêtic act of “doing-undoing-redoing” therein offers a subversive alternative to—even critique of—certain utilitarian technological developments (within both coding and weaving) which in privileging efficiency and optimization can delimit creative possibilities, reducing the potential of human intervention and invention in the seizing of opportunity, accident, chance and contingency.","author":[{"family":"Cocker","given":"Emma"}],"citation-key":"cockerWeavingCodesCoding2017","container-title":"TEXTILE","DOI":"10.1080/14759756.2017.1298233","ISSN":"1475-9756","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,4,3]]},"page":"124-141","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Weaving Codes/Coding Weaves: Penelopean Mêtis and the Weaver-Coder’s Kairos","title-short":"Weaving Codes/Coding Weaves","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/14759756.2017.1298233","volume":"15"},
  {"id":"cockerWhatNowWhat2018","abstract":"Drawing on my experience as a critical interlocutor within the AHRC research projects Live Notation: Transforming Matters of Performance (2012) and Weaving Codes | Coding Weaves (2014–2016), in this article, I propose a conceptual framework for considering the challenges and opportunities for kairotic improvisation within live coding, conceived as an embodied mode of imminent and immanent intervention and invention-in-the-middle, a practice of radical timing and timeliness. Expanding my previous reflections on kairotic coding [Cocker, Emma. (2014). “Live Notation: Reflections on a Kairotic Practice.” In Performance Research Journal, on Writing and Digital Media, edited by Jerome Fletcher and Ric Allsopp, 18 (5), 69–76.

(2017). “Weaving Codes/Coding Weaves: Penelopean Mêtis and the Weaver-Coder’s Kairos.” Textile 15 (2): 124–141], in this article, I address the kairotic liveness within live coding’s improvisational performance by identifying two seemingly contradictory tendencies within this burgeoning genre. On the one hand, there is a call for improved media technologies enabling greater immediacy of semantic feedback supporting a faster, more fluid—perhaps even virtuoso—approach to improvisation. Alongside, there remains interest within the live coding community for a mode of improvisational performativity that harnesses the unpredictable, the unexpected or as-yet-unknown. Rather than regard these two tendencies in antagonistic relation, my intent is to invite further debate on how the development of intelligent machines might better facilitate improvisatory flow, without eradicating the critical intervals and in-between spaces necessary for creative invention and intervention, without smoothing away the points of technical resistance and intransigence which arguably form a part of live coding’s performative texture.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Cocker","given":"Emma"}],"citation-key":"cockerWhatNowWhat2018","container-title":"Digital Creativity","DOI":"10.1080/14626268.2017.1419978","ISSN":"1462-6268","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,2]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/14626268.2017.1419978","page":"82-95","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"What now, what next—kairotic coding and the unfolding future seized","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/14626268.2017.1419978","volume":"29"},

  {"id":"collinsGenerativeMusicLaptop2003","abstract":"Live computer music is the perfect medium for generative music systems, for non-linear compositional constructions and for interactive manipulation of sound processing. Unfortunately, much of the complexity of these real-time systems is lost on a potential audience, excepting those few connoisseurs who sneak round the back to check the laptop screen. An artist using powerful software like SuperCollider or PD cannot be readily distinguished from someone checking their e-mail whilst DJ-ing with iTunes. Without a culture of understanding of both the laptop performer and current generation graphical and text-programming languages for audio, audiences tend to respond most to often gimmicky controllers, or to the tools they have had more exposure to - the (yawn) superstar DJs and their decks. This article attempts to convey the exciting things that are being explored with algorithmic composition and interactive synthesis techniques in live performance. The reasons for building generative music systems and the forms of control attainable over algorithmic processes are investigated. Direct manual control is set against the use of autonomous software agents. In line with this, four techniques for software control during live performance are introduced, namely presets, previewing, autopilot, and the powerful method of live coding. Finally, audio-visual collaboration is discussed.","author":[{"family":"Collins","given":"Nick"}],"citation-key":"collinsGenerativeMusicLaptop2003","container-title":"Contemporary Music Review","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003]]},"page":"67–79","title":"Generative Music and Laptop Performance","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/gcmr/2003/00000022/00000004/art00009","volume":"22"},

La peculiare dinamica di interrelazione tra piacere estetico, principio di ordine nella variegatura, e armonica disposizione delle parti che contraddistingue la choreia nelle fonti letterarie (e che è illustrata in poesia greca arcaica dalla nozione di ποικιλία) informa ad un tempo la tecnologia e la logica della tessitura, una τέχνη cospicuamente associata nell’immaginario poetico alla ποικιλία e alla coralità. L’analisi dei passi interessati mostra come il verbo πλέκειν (e, in aggiunta ad esso, alcuni composti, sia verbi che aggettivi, dai temi πλεκ-/πλοκ-) è il termine di artigianato tessile più massicciamente impiegato dalle fonti letterarie in riferimento alla composizione poetica e, più specificamente, all’esecuzione di un Coro che danza, con l’epinicio quale sottogenere di lirica corale che in maniera più consistente si appropria della metapoetica della tessitura (in quanto sottogenere lirico-corale meglio attestato, ma anche in parte per questioni di continuità di genere letterario rispetto ad un repertorio di metafore di matrice Proto-Indoeuropea, e in parte per ragioni di pragmatica della performance epinicia). Viene inoltre proposta una rassegna selettiva dell’immagine dell’“intrecciare una danza corale”, con uno sguardo particolare al geranos in quanto esemplificativo di una modalità di danza le cui articolazioni orchestiche potevano prevedere un’interazione con tessuti reali: attraverso il recupero di un’ipotesi formulata in ambito di comparazione etnografica, si propone un possibile (quantunque interamente speculativo) scenario performativo per il geranos.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,30]]},"citation-key":"CraftsmanshipTechnologyChorality2019","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,3]]},"language":"it-IT","title":"Craftsmanship and technology as chorality: the case of weaving imagery in Archaic and Classical choral lyric","title-short":"Craftsmanship and technology as chorality","type":"webpage","URL":"https://dionysusexmachina.it/dionysus2018/?p=4606"},

Two types of musical permutations were used, including retrograde and inverse. In a retrograde permutation, the criterion melody was played backward in the test melody, and in an inverse permutation, an ascending or descending interval in the criterion melody became an opposite in the test melody.

  {"id":"danieleInterplayLinguisticHistorical2004","abstract":"New techniques for comparing rhythm in language and music [1]and new data on musical rhythm from a range of Western societies[2] provide an opportunity to study the relationship betweenlinguistic and musical rhythm in a number of cultures. Specifically,one can ask if ” stress-timed” and ” syllable-timed” languages areassociated with distinctive musical rhythms. If so, then it mightmake sense to speak of stress-timed and syllable-timed music. Inconducting such studies it is important to bear in mind that in anygiven culture there may be historical musical influences which runcounter to linguistic influences. We illustrate this point with anexamination of German/Austrian music. German is a stress-timedlanguage but it appears that the rhythm of much German/Austrianmusic (especially during the Baroque and Classical eras) does notreflect this linguistic rhythm [2]. This may be due to thewell-known influence of Italian music on German music duringthese eras [3]. Some support for this idea comes from a historicalanalysis of German/Austrian music, which shows that this musicbecomes more ” stress-timed” after the end of the Classical period","author":[{"family":"Daniele","given":"Joseph R."},{"family":"Patel","given":"Aniruddh D."}],"citation-key":"danieleInterplayLinguisticHistorical2004","container-title":"Proc. of the 8th Intl.

  {"id":"darkeAssessmentTimbreUsing2005","abstract":"As part of the perceptual processing to form an abstract picture of a sound, the question arises as to how various timbral judgments are made. An early step in these 'processing stages' suggests that comparisons are made with our previous experiences of sounds. These experiences are often given descriptive labels by which we can communicate the concept of a timbre. It follows that a listener might be able to make qualitative assessments of a sound when asked to judge against the perception of this set of verbal attributes. This study looks at the effectiveness of communicating assessment judgments concerning timbre under controlled conditions. The work presented reports on a study where a group of musicians were asked to assess a number of musical sounds against 12 verbal attributes. The study is based around describing and analysing sounds from a subset of pitched European orchestral instruments. Using statistical analysis, the collated judgements are analysed to indicate the level of agreement that can be obtained from a collective view of each attribute. Some evidence of agreement between assessments is shown by the use of group means and variances, along with a preliminary discussion on a few of the reasons behind the inconsistencies.","author":[{"family":"Darke","given":"Graham"}],"citation-key":"darkeAssessmentTimbreUsing2005","container-title":"Proceedings of the Conference on Interdisciplinary Musicology","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005]]},"title":"Assessment of Timbre Using Verbal Attributes","type":"paper-conference"},
  {"id":"dausilioMotorSomatotopySpeech2009","abstract":"Listening to speech recruits a network of fronto-temporo-parietal cortical areas. Classical models consider anterior (motor) sites to be involved in speech production whereas posterior sites are considered to be involved in comprehension. This functional segregation is challenged by action-perception theories suggesting that brain circuits for speech articulation and speech perception are functionally dependent. Although recent data show that speech listening elicits motor activities analogous to production, it's still debated whether motor circuits play a causal contribution to the perception of speech. Here we administered transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to motor cortex controlling lips and tongue during the discrimination of lip- and tongue-articulated phonemes. We found a neurofunctional double dissociation in speech sound discrimination, supporting the idea that motor structures provide a specific functional contribution to the perception of speech sounds. Moreover, our findings show a fine-grained motor somatotopy for speech comprehension. We discuss our results in light of a modified \"motor theory of speech perception\" according to which speech comprehension is grounded in motor circuits not exclusively involved in speech production.","author":[{"family":"D'Ausilio","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Pulvermüller","given":"Friedemann"},{"family":"Salmas","given":"Paola"},{"family":"Bufalari","given":"Ilaria"},{"family":"Begliomini","given":"Chiara"},{"family":"Fadiga","given":"Luciano"}],"citation-key":"dausilioMotorSomatotopySpeech2009","container-title":"Current biology : CB","DOI":"10.1016/j.cub.2009.01.017","ISSN":"1879-0445","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,3]]},"page":"381–385","PMID":"19217297","title":"The motor somatotopy of speech perception.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2009.01.017","volume":"19"},

In algorithmic synaesthesia extensively shared features are created in the two media. Examples of such work by austraLYSIS and others are discussed. What an audience member can cognitively access in such synaesthesia is considered: creators of intermedia works may overestimate this. The fact that a machine can process image and sound in parallel, and by the same algorithm, does not establish that the human brain can. The transparency of an algorithmic process to a listener-viewer-screener is a core issue in auditory display (or `sonification'). Sonification aims to make the segmentation of a data set more accessible than it is when represented numerically or visually, and has many practical and creative applications.

Organized into four sections, chapters explore the music's history, utility, community, politics, and potential for mass consumption. Contributors address such issues as the role of algorithms as co-performers, live coding practices, and discussions of the algorithmic culture as it currently exists and what it can potentially contribute society, education, and ecommerce. Chapters engage particularly with post-human perspectives - what new musics are now being found through algorithmic means which humans could not otherwise have made - and, in reciprocation, how algorithmic music is being assimilated back into human culture and what meanings it subsequently takes.

The classical Turing machine model has long served as the fundamental reference model because an appropriate Turing machine can simulate every other computational model known. The Turing model is a good abstraction for most digital computers because the number of steps to execute a Turing machine algorithm is predictive of the running time of the computation on a digital computer.

  {"id":"dignazioDataFeminism2020","abstract":"A new way of thinking about data science and data ethics that is informed by the ideas of intersectional feminism. Today, data science is a form of power. It has been used to expose injustice, improve health outcomes, and topple governments. But it has also been used to discriminate, police, and surveil. This potential for good, on the one hand, and harm, on the other, makes it essential to ask: Data science by whom? Data science for whom? Data science with whose interests in mind? The narratives around big data and data science are overwhelmingly white, male, and techno-heroic. In Data Feminism, Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein present a new way of thinking about data science and data ethics-one that is informed by intersectional feminist thought. Illustrating data feminism in action, D'Ignazio and Klein show how challenges to the male/female binary can help challenge other hierarchical (and empirically wrong) classification systems. They explain how, for example, an understanding of emotion can expand our ideas about effective data visualization, and how the concept of invisible labor can expose the significant human efforts required by our automated systems. And they show why the data never, ever \"speak for themselves.\" Data Feminism offers strategies for data scientists seeking to learn how feminism can help them work toward justice, and for feminists who want to focus their efforts on the growing field of data science. But Data Feminism is about much more than gender. It is about power, about who has it and who doesn't, and about how those differentials of power can be challenged and changed.","author":[{"family":"D`ignazio","given":"Catherine"},{"family":"Klein","given":"Lauren F."}],"citation-key":"dignazioDataFeminism2020","event-place":"Cambridge, Massachusetts","ISBN":"978-0-262-04400-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"328","publisher":"MIT Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, Massachusetts","source":"Amazon","title":"Data Feminism","type":"book"},

Amusic subjects were also less prone to interference in a spatial stimulus-response incompatibility task and performed significantly faster than controls in an interference task in which they were required to make simple pitch discriminations while concurrently performing a mental rotation task. This indicates that the processing of pitch in music normally depends on the cognitive mechanisms that are used to process spatial representations in other modalities.","author":[{"family":"Douglas","given":"Katie M."},{"family":"Bilkey","given":"David K."}],"citation-key":"douglasAmusiaAssociatedDeficits2007","container-title":"Nature Neuroscience","DOI":"10.1038/nn1925","ISSN":"1097-6256","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,6]]},"page":"915–921","PMID":"17589505","title":"Amusia is associated with deficits in spatial processing","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nn1925","volume":"10"},

In this paper, we approach this phenomenon, which we term code decay, scientifically and statistically. We define code decay and propose a number of measurements (code decay indices) on software and on the organizations that produce it, that serve as symptoms, risk factors, and predictors of decay. Using an unusually rich data set (the fifteen-plus year change history of the millions of lines of software for a telephone switching system), we find mixed, but on the whole persuasive, statistical evidence of code decay, which is corroborated by developers of the code. Suggestive indications that perfective maintenance can retard code decay are also discussed.","author":[{"family":"Eick","given":"Stephen G."},{"family":"Graves","given":"Todd L."},{"family":"Karr","given":"Alan F."},{"family":"Marron","given":"J.

The neural basis for this creative technical activity later provided the brain functions on which language could develop.

  {"id":"fanfaniMicroPerformingAncient2020","abstract":"What does an ancient weaver know, when she knows how to weave? How is this complex knowledge graspable and representable? The article presents the research practice of the PENELOPE project as it sets to explore the distinctive logic and order of ancient weaving − an inferential dimension embedded in the material and thus mainly implicit, which is best grasped through performing and which we address here as microperformative. In archaic Greek literary and philosophical sources, weaving is cast as a technology capable of imposing order, creating complex structure, and providing a model for cosmic generation. This pre-scientific ‘knowledge through order’ that weaving affords is in turn embedded in a performance culture where notions like kosmos and poikilia refer to woven fabrics, performances of song-and-dance, patterns in nature and in craft. The production of textile patterns incorporates the organization of elements into wholes in a way that is logical and algorithmic yet still unsuited to be laid down in writing. The mode of knowing specific to weaving is a liminal notion at the intersection of technology, knowledge, and embodied practice. Labelling this mode of ordering as microperformativity, one implication is that reflective decision-making, non-propositional knowledge and material agency all have a bearing on how in weaving threads perform together with the algorithm employed by the weaver, who needs to make decisions on repeats and recursion to generate a coherent whole. Using self-made technology, we then attempt to convey through performances the elements included as separate acts in weaving on the warp-weighted loom of antiquity. The order and patterns of weaving circulate through a multimodal and multimedial performance where the rhythms of ancient Greek poetry, manipulated as musical pattern by the live coder, govern the choreography of a set of synchronized arachnoid robots plaiting a braid by dancing around a maypole.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Fanfani","given":"Giovanni"},{"family":"Griffiths","given":"Dave"},{"family":"Harlizius-Klück","given":"Ellen"},{"family":"Mamidipudi","given":"Annapurna"},{"family":"McLean","given":"Alex"}],"citation-key":"fanfaniMicroPerformingAncient2020","container-title":"Performance Research","DOI":"10.1080/13528165.2020.1807772","ISSN":"1352-8165","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,2]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/13528165.2020.1807772","page":"123-130","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"(Micro-)Performing Ancient Weaving in the PENELOPE project","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/13528165.2020.1807772","volume":"25"},

  {"id":"fayDesignAdaptationConvention2004","abstract":"To study the development of graphical conventions we had members of a simulated community play a series of graphical interaction games with partners drawn from the same pool (Experiment 1). Once the community was established, a conventional referring scheme emerged that facilitated high levels of semantic coordination, with reduced communicative effort. Next, a forced choice reaction time study (Experiment 2) demonstrated that graphical conventions developed in communities offer a distinct processing advantage when compared with those developed by isolated pairs (i.e. participants who always interact with the same partner). This is interpreted as evidence that the graphical conventions that evolve within a closed community constitute higher order cognitions, the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. Background Vygotsky (1981) claims that higher order cognition is a product of social interaction, that novel structures emerge as a consequence of interpersonal, as opposed to intrapersonal, communication. Hutchins (1995) shares this view, arguing that higher order cognition is a cultural product, a consequence of interaction (humanenvironment and human-human) that is distributed across time and space. According to Hutchins, higher order cognitions emerge from ” an adaptive process that accumulates partial solutions to frequently encountered problems ” (p.354). Lewis (1969, 1975) defines conventions in a comparable way, as arising from situations where a community faces the recurrent problem of coordination. If we agree that conventions are cultural products, should we accept that they represent higher order cognitions?

  {"id":"finneyRealtimeDataCollection2001","abstract":"Multiuser UNIX-like operating systems such as Linux are often considered unsuitable for real-time data collection because of the potential for indeterminate timing latencies resulting from preemptive scheduling. In this paper, Linux is shown to be fully adequate for precisely controlled programming with millisecond resolution or better. The Linux system calls that subserve such timing control are described and tested and then utilized in a MIDI-based program for tapping and music performance experiments. The timing of this program, including data input and output, is shown to be accurate at the millisecond level. This demonstrates that Linux, with proper programming, is suitable for real-time experiment software. In addition, the detailed description and test of both the operating system facilities and the application program itself may serve as a model for publicly documenting programming methods and software performance on other operating systems.","author":[{"family":"Finney","given":"Steven A."}],"citation-key":"finneyRealtimeDataCollection2001","container-title":"Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2001,5]]},"page":"167–173","title":"Real-time data collection in Linux: A case study","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://brm.psychonomic-journals.org/content/33/2/167.abstract","volume":"33"},

  {"id":"fishwickAestheticComputingLeonardo2008","abstract":"In _Aesthetic Computing_, key scholars and practitioners from art, design, computer science, and mathematics lay the foundations for a discipline that applies the theory and practice of art to computing. Aesthetic computing explores the way art and aesthetics can play a role in different areas of computer science. One of its goals is to modify computer science by the application of the wide range of definitions and categories normally associated with making art. For example, structures in computing might be represented using the style of Gaudi or the Bauhaus school. This goes beyond the usual definition of aesthetics in computing, which most often refers to the formal, abstract qualities of such structures—a beautiful proof, or an elegant diagram. The contributors to this book discuss the broader spectrum of aesthetics—from abstract qualities of symmetry and form to ideas of creative expression and pleasure—in the context of computer science. The assumption behind aesthetic computing is that the field of computing will be enriched if it embraces all of aesthetics. Human-computer interaction will benefit—\"usability,\" for example, could refer to improving a user's emotional state—and new models of learning will emerge. _Aesthetic Computing_ approaches its subject from a variety of perspectives. After defining the field and placing it in its historical context, the book looks at art and design, mathematics and computing, and interface and interaction. Contributions range from essays on the art of visualization and \"the poesy of programming\" to discussions of the aesthetics of mathematics throughout history and transparency and reflectivity in interface design. **Contributors**: James Alty, Olav W.

In this paper, we develop a novel method for using the rhythm of everyday actions as a basis for identifying the characteristic appearance and sounds associated with objects, people, and the robot itself. Our approach is to identify and segment groups of signals in individual modalities (sight, hearing, and proprioception) based on their rhythmic variation, then to identify and bind causally-related groups of signals across different modalities. By including proprioception as a modality, this cross-modal binding method applies to the robot itself, and we report a series of experiments in which the robot learns about the characteristics of its own body.","author":[{"family":"Fitzpatrick","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Arsenio","given":"Artur"}],"citation-key":"fitzpatrickFeelBeatUsing2004","editor":[{"family":"Berthouze","given":"Luc"},{"family":"Kozima","given":"Hideki"},{"family":"Prince","given":"Christopher G."},{"family":"Sandini","given":"Giulio"},{"family":"Stojanov","given":"Georgi"},{"family":"Metta","given":"Giorgio"},{"family":"Balkenius","given":"Christian"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2004]]},"number-of-pages":"59–66","publisher":"Lund University Cognitive Studies","title":"Feel the beat: using cross-modal rhythm to integrate perception of objects, others, and self","type":"book","URL":"http://cogprints.org/4062/","volume":"117"},

  {"id":"flashCoordinationArmMovements1985","abstract":"This paper presents studies of the coordination of voluntary human arm movements. A mathematical model is formulated which is shown to predict both the qualitative features and the quantitative details observed experimentally in planar, multijoint arm movements. Coordination is modeled mathematically by defining an objective function, a measure of performance for any possible movement. The unique trajectory which yields the best performance is determined using dynamic optimization theory. In the work presented here, the objective function is the square of the magnitude of jerk (rate of change of acceleration) of the hand integrated over the entire movement. This is equivalent to assuming that a major goal of motor coordination is the production of the smoothest possible movement of the hand. Experimental observations of human subjects performing voluntary unconstrained movements in a horizontal plane are presented. They confirm the following predictions of the mathematical model: unconstrained point-to-point motions are approximately straight with bell-shaped tangential velocity profiles; curved motions (through an intermediate point or around an obstacle) have portions of low curvature joined by portions of high curvature; at points of high curvature, the tangential velocity is reduced; the durations of the low-curvature portions are approximately equal. The theoretical analysis is based solely on the kinematics of movement independent of the dynamics of the musculoskeletal system and is successful only when formulated in terms of the motion of the hand in extracorporal space. The implications with respect to movement organization are discussed.","author":[{"family":"Flash","given":"T."},{"family":"Hogan","given":"N."}],"citation-key":"flashCoordinationArmMovements1985","container-title":"The Journal of Neuroscience","ISSN":"1529-2401","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[1985,7]]},"page":"1688–1703","PMID":"4020415","title":"The coordination of arm movements: an experimentally confirmed mathematical model","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jneurosci.org/content/5/7/1688.abstract","volume":"5"},

Recordings of metal objects being struck with percussion mallets were rated by subjects on a unidimensional perceptual scale of perceived mallet hardness. Four acoustical parameters of the attack portion (first 325 ms) were defined and evaluated as predictors of perceived mallet hardness rating. To measure these parameters, a critical-band filter bank was employed. Two curves were extracted from the filter-bank output: (1) spectral level (log of area under spectrum) over time, and (2) spectral centroid over time. For each curve, two parameters were measured: the mean and the slope of the spectral level curve, and the mean and the time-weighted average of the spectral centroid curve. Multiple regression analysis was used to relate the perceptual ratings to these four acoustical parameters, and a good fit was achieved (multiple R-squared=0.725, F=1135.8, p<0.01). The resulting function is suitable for quantitatively predicting the perceptual dimension of perceived mallet hardness.","author":[{"family":"Freed","given":"Daniel J."}],"citation-key":"freedAuditoryCorrelatesPerceived1990","container-title":"The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America","DOI":"10.1121/1.399298","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1990]]},"page":"311–322","title":"Auditory correlates of perceived mallet hardness for a set of recorded percussive sound events","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/1.399298","volume":"87"},

Here, we report a crosscultural study with participants from a native African population (Mafa) and Western participants, with both groups being naive to the music of the other respective culture. Experiment 1 investigated the ability to recognize three basic emotions (happy, sad, scared/fearful) expressed in Western music. Results show that the Mafas recognized happy, sad, and scared/fearful Western music excerpts above chance, indicating that the expression of these basic emotions in Western music can be recognized universally. Experiment 2 examined how a spectral manipulation of original, naturalistic music affects the perceived pleasantness of music in Western as well as in Mafa listeners. The spectral manipulation modified, among other factors, the sensory dissonance of the music. The data show that both groups preferred original Western music and also original Mafa music over their spectrally manipulated versions. It is likely that the sensory dissonance produced by the spectral manipulation was at least partly responsible for this effect, suggesting that consonance and permanent sensory dissonance universally influence the perceived pleasantness of music.","author":[{"family":"Fritz","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Jentschke","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Gosselin","given":"Nathalie"},{"family":"Sammler","given":"Daniela"},{"family":"Peretz","given":"Isabelle"},{"family":"Turner","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Friederici","given":"Angela D."},{"family":"Koelsch","given":"Stefan"}],"citation-key":"fritzUniversalRecognitionThree2009","container-title":"Current Biology","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,4]]},"page":"573–576","title":"Universal Recognition of Three Basic Emotions in Music","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(09)00813-6","volume":"19"},

  {"id":"gabrielssonComplexitiesRhythm1993","abstract":"This book deals with the complex cognitive processes involved in understanding two \"horizontal\" aspects of music perception, melody and rhythm, both separately and together. Focusing on the tonal framework for pitch material in melodies, the first section provides evidence that mere exposure to music organized in a particular way is sufficient to induce the auditory system to prepare itself to receive further input conforming to the patterns already experienced. Its chapters also offer evidence concerning elaborations of those basic schemes that come about through specialized training in music. Continuing themes from the first section – such as the hypothesis that melodies must be treated as integral wholes and not mere collections of elements – the second section discusses the integration of melody and rhythm. In these chapters there is an underlying concern for clarifying the relation – central to aesthetic questions – between physical patterns of sound energy in the world and our psychological experience of them. The chapters in the third section provide excellent examples of the new, scientific literature that attempts to objectively study early musical abilities. Their data establish that infants and young children are far more perceptive and skilled appreciators of music than was thought a decade ago.","author":[{"family":"Gabrielsson","given":"Alf"}],"citation-key":"gabrielssonComplexitiesRhythm1993","container-title":"Psychology and Music: The Understanding of Melody and Rhythm","editor":[{"family":"Tighe","given":"Thomas J."},{"family":"Dowling","given":"W.

  {"id":"gardenforsConceptualSpacesGeometry2000","abstract":"Within cognitive science, two approaches currently dominate the problem of modeling representations. The symbolic approach views cognition as computation involving symbolic manipulation. Connectionism, a special case of associationism, models associations using artificial neuron networks. Peter Gardenfors offers his theory of conceptual representations as a bridge between the symbolic and connectionist approaches.<br /> <br /> Symbolic representation is particularly weak at modeling concept learning, which is paramount for understanding many cognitive phenomena. Concept learning is closely tied to the notion of similarity, which is also poorly served by the symbolic approach. Gardenfors's theory of conceptual spaces presents a framework for representing information on the conceptual level. A conceptual space is built up from geometrical structures based on a number of quality dimensions. The main applications of the theory are on the constructive side of cognitive science: as a constructive model the theory can be applied to the development of artificial systems capable of solving cognitive tasks. Gardenfors also shows how conceptual spaces can serve as an explanatory framework for a number of empirical theories, in particular those concerning concept formation, induction, and semantics. His aim is to present a coherent research program that can be used as a basis for more detailed investigations.","author":[{"family":"Gärdenfors","given":"Peter"}],"citation-key":"gardenforsConceptualSpacesGeometry2000","ISBN":"0-262-07199-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2000,3]]},"note":"Published: Hardcover","publisher":"The MIT Press","title":"Conceptual Spaces: The Geometry of Thought","type":"book","URL":"http://www.worldcat.org/isbn/0262071991"},

  {"id":"gerraNeuroendocrineResponsesHealthy1998","abstract":"A variety of studies reported psychological and physiological effects of music. Different types of music have been found to induce different neuroendocrine changes. The aim of the present experiment was to investigate the possible combination of emotional and endocrine changes in response to techno-music and to define personality variables as predictors of respective changes. Sixteen psychosomatically healthy subjects (18- to 19-year-olds, eight males and eight females) were exposed, in random order, to techno-music or to classical music (30 min each). Plasma norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (EPI), growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) cortisol (CORT), Î²-endorphin (Î²-EP) concentrations and changes of emotional state were measured in basal conditions and after the experimental trials with two different types of music. Techno-music was associated with a significant increase in heart rate, systolic blood pressure and significant changes in self-rated emotional states. A significant increase was observed in Î²-EP, ACTH, NE, GH and CORT after listening to techno-music. Classical music induced an improvement in emotional state, but no significant changes in hormonal concentrations. No differences between male and female subjects' responses to music have been found. Plasma levels of PRL and EPI were unaffected by techno- and classical music. Changes in emotional state and NE, Î²-EP and GH responses to techno-music correlated negatively with harm avoidance scores and positively with the novelty-seeking temperament score on the Cloninger scale. Listening to techno-music induces changes in neurotransmitters, peptides and hormonal reactions, related to mental state and emotional involvement: personality traits and temperament may influence the wide inter-individual variability in response to music.","author":[{"family":"Gerra","given":"G."},{"family":"Zaimovic","given":"A."},{"family":"Franchini","given":"D."},{"family":"Palladino","given":"M."},{"family":"Giucastro","given":"G."},{"family":"Reali","given":"N."},{"family":"Maestri","given":"D."},{"family":"Caccavari","given":"R."},{"family":"Delsignore","given":"R."},{"family":"Brambilla","given":"F."}],"citation-key":"gerraNeuroendocrineResponsesHealthy1998","container-title":"International Journal of Psychophysiology","DOI":"10.1016/s0167-8760(97)00071-8","ISSN":"01678760","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1998,1]]},"page":"99–111","title":"Neuroendocrine responses of healthy volunteers to `techno-music': relationships with personality traits and emotional state","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0167-8760(97)00071-8","volume":"28"},

  {"id":"gloverFarmingPerformanceConceptual2018","abstract":"In two widely cited articles, the first of which was published almost 30 years ago, the anthropologist Paul Richards described the situated practices of small-scale farmers as a type of performance, akin to a musical or theatrical performance (1989, 1993). This definition, applied specifically to small-scale and subsistence agriculture, has a powerful appeal for good reasons. This article examines performance as a conceptual framework and tool for studying small-scale farming practice and technological change. Taking the comparison with musical or theatrical endeavour seriously, the article explores the dynamics of performance by individuals and groups; considers alternative ways of conceiving the 'stage' and the 'audience'; and examines the nature of the performers' skills and competence, through an elaboration of key concepts such as practice, rehearsal, repertoire and improvisation. The article also discusses the important implications of a performance being situated in a particular time and place, shaped by its surrounding socio-cultural and ecological context and conditioned by uncertainty. The article proposes that ethnographic or technographic methods are appropriate for studying performance, and considers the ethical responsibilities of the researcher when intervening in a performance from its outside.

  {"id":"grahnRhythmBeatPerception2007","abstract":"When we listen to rhythm, we often move spontaneously to the beat. This movement may result from processing of the beat by motor areas. Previous studies have shown that several motor areas respond when attending to rhythms. Here we investigate whether specific motor regions respond to beat in rhythm. We predicted that the basal ganglia and supplementary motor area (SMA) would respond in the presence of a regular beat. To establish what rhythm properties induce a beat, we asked subjects to reproduce different types of rhythmic sequences. Improved reproduction was observed for one rhythm type, which had integer ratio relationships between its intervals and regular perceptual accents. A subsequent functional magnetic resonance imaging study found that these rhythms also elicited higher activity in the basal ganglia and SMA. This finding was consistent across different levels of musical training, although musicians showed activation increases unrelated to rhythm type in the premotor cortex, cerebellum, and SMAs (pre-SMA and SMA). We conclude that, in addition to their role in movement production, the basal ganglia and SMAs may mediate beat perception.","author":[{"family":"Grahn","given":"Jessica A."},{"family":"Brett","given":"Matthew"}],"citation-key":"grahnRhythmBeatPerception2007","container-title":"Journal of cognitive neuroscience","DOI":"10.1162/jocn.2007.19.5.893","ISSN":"0898-929X","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,5]]},"page":"893–906","PMID":"17488212","title":"Rhythm and beat perception in motor areas of the brain.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/jocn.2007.19.5.893","volume":"19"},

  {"id":"greyMultidimensionalPerceptualScaling1977","abstract":"Two experiments were performed to evaluate the perceptual relationships between 16 music instrument tones. The stimuli were computer synthesized based upon an analysis of actual instrument tones, and they were perceptually equalized for loudness, pitch, and duration. Experiment 1 evaluated the tones with respect to perceptual similarities, and the results were treated with multidimensional scaling techniques and hierarchic clustering analysis. A three‐dimensional scaling solution, well matching the clustering analysis, was found to be interpretable in terms of (1) the spectral energy distribution; (2) the presence of synchronicity in the transients of the higher harmonics, along with the closely related amount of spectral fluctuation within the the tone through time; and (3) the presence of low‐amplitude, high‐frequency energy in the initial attack segment; an alternate interpretation of the latter two dimensions viewed the cylindrical distribution of clusters of stimulus points about the spectral energy distribution, grouping on the basis of musical instrument family (with two exceptions). Experiment 2 was a learning task of a set of labels for the 16 tones. Confusions were examined in light of the similarity structure for the tones from experiment 1, and one of the family‐grouping exceptions was found to be reflected in the difficulty of learning the labels.","author":[{"family":"Grey","given":"John M."}],"citation-key":"greyMultidimensionalPerceptualScaling1977","container-title":"The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America","DOI":"10.1121/1.381428","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[1977,5]]},"page":"1270–1277","title":"Multidimensional perceptual scaling of musical timbres","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/1.381428","volume":"61"},

Different aspects of weaving, including plain weave, a four-shaft loom, tablet weaving and warp-weighted weaving are simulated, in order to gain greater understanding of the craft from the perspective of computer science. The production rules of L-Systems are employed to begin to explore the expansive possibilities offered even by our simple simulations. In order to test our models and gain deeper understanding, the languages we produce are interpreted both as computer simulations and by our human selves, through the weaving of textile by hand. Physical user interfaces are introduced, in order to help communicate the structures and thought processes of weaving. Finally, we share our approach to representing a weave from the point of view of a thread. Throughout, our aim is not to simulate a weave in its entirety, but to gain and share insights into its complexity, and begin see how the long history of weaving, as a fundamentally digital yet ancient craft, can inform the younger fields of computer science and engineering.","author":[{"family":"Griffiths","given":"David"},{"family":"McLean","given":"Alex"}],"citation-key":"griffithsTextilityCodeCatalogue2017","container-title":"TEXTILE","DOI":"10.1080/14759756.2017.1298308","ISSN":"1475-9756","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,4,3]]},"page":"198-214","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Textility of Code: A Catalogue of Errors","title-short":"Textility of Code","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/14759756.2017.1298308","volume":"15"},

Experiment 1 found evidence for direct access in linguistic processing and callosal relay in prosodic processing. Direct access for linguistic processing was found to depend on lexical status (Experiment 2) and affective prosody (Experiment 3).

  {"id":"guzdialImagineeringInauthenticLegitimate2006","abstract":"Since its publication, Lave and Wenger's concept of legitimate peripheral participation (LPP) [18] has become an important concept for understanding situated learning. LPP states that learning only occurs when students perceive that what's being taught is aligned with their goals (in LPP terms, with the students' perceived community of practice). This has implications for our traditional CS courses (e.g., are we teaching what the students perceive as being relevant for their future careers?), but even greater implications for courses for non-CS majors. When computer science educators are asked to teach non-CS majors, we are often placed in the position of teaching in alignment with a community of practice that does not, or does not yet, exist. In that sense, our teaching is inauthentic—not aligned with a community of practice. However, there is the possibility that we can generate a perception of authenticity or alignment. We use the example of two classes at Georgia Tech that seem successful by several measures, yet suffer this inauthenticity. We propose that a useful tool for understanding how these classes work is the Disney Corporation's Imagineering—their process of story-telling in three-dimensions as used in their theme parks. However, in the end, we find that what students actually learn is not necessarily the story that we are telling them, which points toward future research.","author":[{"family":"Guzdial","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Tew","given":"Allison E."}],"citation-key":"guzdialImagineeringInauthenticLegitimate2006","collection-title":"ICER '06","container-title":"Proceedings of the second international workshop on Computing education research","DOI":"10.1145/1151588.1151597","event-place":"Canterbury, United Kingdom","ISBN":"1-59593-494-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006]]},"page":"51–58","publisher":"ACM","publisher-place":"Canterbury, United Kingdom","title":"Imagineering inauthentic legitimate peripheral participation: an instructional design approach for motivating computing education","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1151588.1151597"},

In Experiment 1, North American adults rated structure-violating alterations as less similar to the original version than structure-preserving alterations for simple-meter patterns but not for complex-meter patterns. In Experiment 2, adults of Bulgarian or Macedonian origin provided differential ratings to structure-violating and structure-preserving alterations in complex- as well as simple-meter contexts. In Experiment 3, 6-month-old infants responded differentially to structure-violating and structure-preserving alterations in both metrical contexts.

  {"id":"harlizius-kluckOrdersAncientWeaving2016","abstract":"This study arises from an interest in the question of how ancient weaving technology affected early Greek conceits of poetry-making and cosmic order, and how poetic composition as technē resembles the order of nature (the poem is defined as a ‘kosmos of words’). It is argued that ancient textile technology, lying at the etymological and conceptual root of a significant sample of archaic Greek terminology for poetics, generates patterns of thoughts that are relevant for the emergence of early Greek scientific and mathematical discourse. In turn, textile imagery in poetic and philosophical texts should not be considered a mere rhetorical trope. Following Hans Blumenberg, we consider metaphor and analogy rather as technological means of expressing concepts. In other words, the conceptual import of a given analogy or metaphor is not simply illustrated, but generated by the particular principles of weaving technology at the root of the ‘literal’ element in the figure. In the case of ancient weaving, that is, literary imagery seems best accessed through technology. On such premises, the paper explores the potential correspondences between a structural feature of weaving on the warp-weighted loom, namely the ordering band providing the starting border of the fabric, and the function of the cross-generic prooimion, a compositional and performative principle of orderly beginning, in a sample of archaic Greek poetry.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Harlizius-Klück","given":"Ellen"},{"family":"Fanfani","given":"Giovanni"}],"citation-key":"harlizius-kluckOrdersAncientWeaving2016","collection-number":"24","collection-title":"Ancient Textile Series","container-title":"Spinning Fates and the Song of the Loom.

  {"id":"harlizius-kluckWeavingBinaryArt2017","abstract":"To refer to the Jacquard loom as a precursor of the computer is a common narrative in histories of computing beginning with Ada Lovelace comparing the punched card operated loom with the calculating engine designed by Charles Babbage: “We may say most aptly that the Analytical Engine weaves algebraical patterns just as the Jacquard-loom weaves flowers and leaves.” But this does not mean that Jacquard invented the algebra of patterns. He only constructed the first widely known and used mechanism replacing the drawboy by punched cards to feed pattern information into his mechanism. To control a weave means to decide whether a warp thread is to be picked up or not. Weaving has therefore been a binary art from its very beginning, applying operations of pattern algebra for millennia. Jacquard’s cards were the end of this story rather than its beginning, reducing the weaver to an operator who had to step on a single treadle repeatedly. This article argues that algebra is already involved in operating shafts or heddles on ordinary looms, that this algebra was applied tacitly until the first weaving notations were developed, and that these notations make the tacit algebra of patterns recognizable to non-weavers: inventors and engineers.","author":[{"family":"Harlizius-Klück","given":"Ellen"}],"citation-key":"harlizius-kluckWeavingBinaryArt2017","container-title":"TEXTILE","DOI":"10.1080/14759756.2017.1298239","ISSN":"1475-9756","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,4,3]]},"page":"176-197","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Weaving as Binary Art and the Algebra of Patterns","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14759756.2017.1298239","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"hassabisPatientsHippocampalAmnesia2007","abstract":"Amnesic patients have a well established deficit in remembering their past experiences. Surprisingly, however, the question as to whether such patients can imagine new experiences has not been formally addressed to our knowledge. We tested whether a group of amnesic patients with primary damage to the hippocampus bilaterally could construct new imagined experiences in response to short verbal cues that outlined a range of simple commonplace scenarios. Our results revealed that patients were markedly impaired relative to matched control subjects at imagining new experiences. Moreover, we identified a possible source for this deficit. The patients' imagined experiences lacked spatial coherence, consisting instead of fragmented images in the absence of a holistic representation of the environmental setting. The hippocampus, therefore, may make a critical contribution to the creation of new experiences by providing the spatial context into which the disparate elements of an experience can be bound. Given how closely imagined experiences match episodic memories, the absence of this function mediated by the hippocampus, may also fundamentally affect the ability to vividly re-experience the past.","author":[{"family":"Hassabis","given":"Demis"},{"family":"Kumaran","given":"Dharshan"},{"family":"Vann","given":"Seralynne D."},{"family":"Maguire","given":"Eleanor A."}],"citation-key":"hassabisPatientsHippocampalAmnesia2007","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.0610561104","ISSN":"1091-6490","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,1]]},"page":"1726–1731","PMCID":"PMC1773058","PMID":"17229836","title":"Patients with hippocampal amnesia cannot imagine new experiences","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0610561104","volume":"104"},

The example of The Hub raises the question of technological change and the necessity of considering the external forces that bear on the instrumentarium of algorithmic music as part of its social ecology. The chapter analyses live coding, focusing on the associated actors’ use of the Internet.

Several research areas claim the STS as the host brain region for their particular behavior of interest. Some see it as one of the core structures for theory of mind. For others, it is the main region for audiovisual integration. It plays an important role in biological motion perception, but is also claimed to be essential for speech processing and processing of faces. We review the foci of activations in the STS from multiple functional magnetic resonance imaging studies, focusing on theory of mind, audiovisual integration, motion processing, speech processing, and face processing. The results indicate a differentiation of the STS region in an anterior portion, mainly involved in speech processing, and a posterior portion recruited by cognitive demands of all these different research areas. The latter finding argues against a strict functional subdivision of the STS. In line with anatomical evidence from tracer studies, we propose that the function of the STS varies depending on the nature of network coactivations with different regions in the frontal cortex and medial-temporal lobe. This view is more in keeping with the notion that the same brain region can support different cognitive operations depending on task-dependent network connections, emphasizing the role of network connectivity analysis in neuroimaging.","author":[{"family":"Hein","given":"Grit"},{"family":"Knight","given":"Robert T."}],"citation-key":"heinSuperiorTemporalSulcus2008","container-title":"J.

Here, we investigated to what extent the absence of prosodic information influences lateralization. MEG brain-responses indicated that syntactic violations lead to early bi-lateral brain responses for syntax violations. When the pitch of sentences was flattened to diminish prosodic cues, the brain's syntax response was lateralized to the right hemisphere, indicating that the missing pitch was generated automatically by the brain when it was absent.

The system uses a grammar to parse code patterns and create random mutations that conform to the grammar, thus guaranteeing that the resulting pattern has the correct syntax. With these mutations available, we provide a facility to integrate them during a live performance. To achieve this, we added controls to the Extramuros web client that allows coders to select patterns for submission to the Tidal interpreter. The fitness of the pattern is updated implicitly by the way the coder uses the patterns. In this way, appropriate patterns are continuously generated and selected for throughout a performance.

  {"id":"hicksProgrammedInequalityHow2017","abstract":"How Britain lost its early dominance in computing by systematically discriminating against its most qualified workers: women.In 1944, Britain led the world in electronic computing. By 1974, the British computer industry was all but extinct. What happened in the intervening thirty years holds lessons for all postindustrial superpowers. As Britain struggled to use technology to retain its global power, the nation's inability to manage its technical labor force hobbled its transition into the information age. In Programmed Inequality, Marie Hicks explores the story of labor feminization and gendered technocracy that undercut British efforts to computerize. That failure sprang from the government's systematic neglect of its largest trained technical workforce simply because they were women. Women were a hidden engine of growth in high technology from World War II to the 1960s. As computing experienced a gender flip, becoming male-identified in the 1960s and 1970s, labor problems grew into structural ones and gender discrimination caused the nation's largest computer user―the civil service and sprawling public sector―to make decisions that were disastrous for the British computer industry and the nation as a whole.Drawing on recently opened government files, personal interviews, and the archives of major British computer companies, Programmed Inequality takes aim at the fiction of technological meritocracy. Hicks explains why, even today, possessing technical skill is not enough to ensure that women will rise to the top in science and technology fields. Programmed Inequality shows how the disappearance of women from the field had grave macroeconomic consequences for Britain, and why the United States risks repeating those errors in the twenty-first century.","author":[{"family":"Hicks","given":"Marie"},{"family":"Aspray","given":"William"},{"family":"Misa","given":"Thomas J."}],"citation-key":"hicksProgrammedInequalityHow2017","edition":"1st edition","event-place":"Cambridge, MA","ISBN":"978-0-262-03554-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,3,3]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"352","publisher":"MIT Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, MA","source":"Amazon","title":"Programmed Inequality: How Britain Discarded Women Technologists and Lost Its Edge in Computing","title-short":"Programmed Inequality","type":"book"},

In practice, however, this may not set us back very far; almost a decade ago, Crick wrote: &#039;Everyone has a rough idea of what is meant by consciousness. It is better to avoid a precise definition of consciousness because of the dangers of premature definition.

This seems to be as true now as it was then, although the identification of different aspects of consciousness (P-consciousness, A-consciousness, self consciousness, and monitoring consciousness) by Block (1995) has certainly brought a degree of clarification.

In particular, we attempted to shed new light on whether babies know that they are acquiring different lexicons right from the start, or whether early bilingual exposure causes them to be semantically confused. We propose a collection of research methods that, taken together, can answer these questions, which have hitherto received scant attention. Six hearing babies were videotaped for one hour on average seven times over one year (ages ranging from 0;7 to 2;2); three babies were acquiring French and English, and three French and LSQ. These populations offer unique insights into the semantic knowledge underlying bilingual as well as monolingual language acquisition. We found that the babies (1) acquired their two languages on the same timetable as monolinguals and (2) produced translation equivalents in their very first lexicons. Further, their early words (signs) in each language (3) were constrained along kind boundaries, (4) showed fundamentally similar semantic organization across their dual lexicons, and (5) reflected the meanings of their favorite things first. We also discuss why attributions that young bilinguals are delayed and confused have prevailed and we show that they are neither at this point in development. Finally, the present findings show how research of this type can provide a method for making bilingual norms wholly attainable.","author":[{"family":"Holowka","given":"Siobhan"},{"family":"Brosseau-Lapré","given":"Françoise"},{"family":"Petitto","given":"Laura A."}],"citation-key":"holowkaSemanticConceptualKnowledge2002","container-title":"Language Learning","DOI":"10.1111/0023-8333.00184","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002]]},"page":"205–262","title":"Semantic and Conceptual Knowledge Underlying Bilingual Babies' First Signs and Words","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/0023-8333.00184","volume":"52"},

Although perceiving speech begins with auditory processing, investigation of speech perception has progressed mostly independently of study of the auditory system. Nevertheless, a growing body of evidence demonstrates that cross-fertilization between the two areas of research can be productive. We briefly describe research bridging the study of general auditory processing and speech perception, showing that the latter is constrained and influenced by operating characteristics of the auditory system and that our understanding of the processes involved in speech perception is enhanced by study within a more general framework. The disconnect between the two areas of research has stunted the development of a truly interdisciplinary science, but there is an opportunity for great strides in understanding with the development of an integrated field of auditory cognitive science.","author":[{"family":"Holt","given":"Lori L."},{"family":"Lotto","given":"Andrew J."}],"citation-key":"holtSpeechPerceptionAuditory2008","container-title":"Current directions in psychological science : a journal of the American Psychological Society","DOI":"10.1111/j.1467-8721.2008.00545.x","ISSN":"1467-8721","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,2]]},"page":"42–46","PMCID":"PMC2593873","PMID":"19060961","title":"Speech Perception Within an Auditory Cognitive Science Framework.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8721.2008.00545.x","volume":"17"},
  {"id":"honorofPerceptionPitchLocation2005","abstract":"Fundamental frequency (F0) is used for many purposes in speech, but its linguistic significance is based on its relation to the speaker's range, not its absolute value. While it may be that listeners can gauge a specific pitch relative to a speaker's range by recognizing it from experience, whether they can do the same for an unfamiliar voice is an open question. The present experiment explored that question. Twenty native speakers of English (10 male, 10 female) produced the vowel /a/ with a spoken (not sung) voice quality at varying pitches within their own ranges. Listeners then judged, without familiarization or context, where each isolated F0 lay within each speaker's range. Correlations were high both for the entire range (0.721) and for the range minus the extremes (0.609). Correlations were somewhat higher when the F0s were related to the range of all the speakers, either separated by sex (0.830) or pooled (0.848), but several factors discussed here may help account for this pattern. Regardless, the present data provide strong support for the hypothesis that listeners are able to locate an F0 reliably within a range without external context or prior exposure to a speaker's voice.","author":[{"family":"Honorof","given":"D.

Particular attention is paid to the main features that characterize modern functional languages: higher-order functions, lazy evaluation, equations and pattern matching, strong static typing and type inference, and data abstraction.

  {"id":"huiRecursivityContingency2019","abstract":"This book employs recursivity and contingency as two principle concepts to investigate into the relation between nature and technology, machine and organism, system and freedom. It reconstructs a trajectory of thought from an Organic condition of thinking elaborated by Kant, passing by the philosophy of nature (Schelling and Hegel), to the 20th century Organicism (Bertalanffy, Needham, Whitehead, Wiener among others) and Organology (Bergson, Canguilhem, Simodnon, Stiegler), and questions the new condition of philosophizing in the time of algorithmic contingency, ecological and algorithmic catastrophes, which Heidegger calls the end of philosophy. The book centres on the following speculative question: if in the philosophical tradition, the concept of contingency is always related to the laws of nature, then in what way can we understand contingency in related to technical systems? The book situates the concept of recursivity as a break from the Cartesian mechanism and the drive of system construction; it elaborates on the necessity of contingency in such epistemological rupture where nature ends and system emerges. In this development, we see how German idealism is precursor to cybernetics, and the Anthropocene and Noosphere (Teilhard de Chardin) point toward the realization of a gigantic cybernetic system, which lead us back to the question of freedom. It questions the concept of absolute contingency (Meillassoux) and proposes a cosmotechnical pluralism. Engaging with modern and contemporary European philosophy as well as Chinese thought through the mediation of Needham, this book refers to cybernetics, mathematics, artificial intelligence and inhumanism.","author":[{"family":"Hui","given":"Yuk"}],"citation-key":"huiRecursivityContingency2019","event-place":"London ; New York","ISBN":"978-1-78660-052-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,1]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"338","publisher":"Rowman & Littlefield International","publisher-place":"London ; New York","source":"Amazon","title":"Recursivity and Contingency","type":"book"},
  {"id":"huronSweetAnticipationMusic2008","abstract":"The psychological theory of expectation that David Huron proposes in  Sweet Anticipation grew out of the author's experimental efforts to understand how music evokes emotions. These efforts evolved into a general theory of expectation that will prove informative to readers interested in cognitive science and evolutionary psychology as well as those interested in music. The book describes a set of psychological mechanisms and illustrates how these mechanisms work in the case of music. All examples of notated music can be heard on the Web.Huron proposes that emotions evoked by expectation involve five functionally distinct response systems: reaction responses (which engage defensive reflexes); tension responses (where uncertainty leads to stress); prediction responses (which reward accurate prediction); imagination responses (which facilitate deferred gratification); and appraisal responses (which occur after conscious thought is engaged). For real-world events, these five response systems typically produce a complex mixture of feelings. The book identifies some of the aesthetic possibilities afforded by expectation, and shows how common musical devices (such as syncopation, cadence, meter, tonality, and climax) exploit the psychological opportunities. The theory also provides new insights into the physiological psychology of awe, laughter, and spine-tingling chills. Huron traces the psychology of expectations from the patterns of the physical/cultural world through imperfectly learned heuristics used to predict that world to the phenomenal qualia we experienced as we apprehend the world.","author":[{"family":"Huron","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"huronSweetAnticipationMusic2008","event-place":"Cambridge, Mass.; London","ISBN":"978-0-262-58278-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,2,22]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"480","publisher":"MIT Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, Mass.; London","source":"Amazon","title":"Sweet Anticipation: Music and the Psychology of Expectation","title-short":"Sweet Anticipation","type":"book"},

  {"id":"ingoldTextilityMaking2010","abstract":"Contemporary discussions of art and technology continue to work on the assumption that making entails the imposition of form upon the material world, by an agent with a design in mind. Against this hylomorphic model of creation, I argue that the forms of things arise within fields of force and flows of material. It is by intervening in these force-fields and following the lines of flow that practitioners make things. In this view, making is a practice of weaving, in which practitioners bind their own pathways or lines of becoming into the texture of material flows comprising the lifeworld. Rather than reading creativity 'backwards', from a finished object to an initial intention in the mind of an agent, this entails reading it forwards, in an ongoing generative movement that is at once itinerant, improvisatory and rhythmic. To illustrate what this means in practice, I compare carpentry and drawing. In both cases, making is a matter of finding the grain of the world's becoming and following its course. Historically, it was the turn from drawing lines to pulling them straight, between predetermined points, which marked the transition from the textilic to the architectonic, debasing the former as craft while elevating the latter as technology.","author":[{"family":"Ingold","given":"Tim"}],"citation-key":"ingoldTextilityMaking2010","container-title":"Cambridge Journal of Economics","DOI":"10.1093/cje/bep042","ISSN":"1464-3545","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,1]]},"page":"91–102","title":"The textility of making","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cje/bep042","volume":"34"},

In experiment 1, listeners heard sequences of orchestral tones equated for pitch and loudness, and they rated how strongly the instruments segregated. Multidimensional scaling analyses of these ratings revealed that segregation was based on the static and dynamic acoustic attributes that influenced similarity judgements in a previous experiment (P Iverson & CL Krumhansl, 1993). In Experiment 2, listeners heard interleaved melodies and tried to recognize the melodies played by a target timbre. The results extended the findings of Experiment 1 to tones varying pitch.

  {"id":"janerSingingdrivenInterfacesSound2008","abstract":"Together with the sound synthesis engine, the user interface, or controller, is a basic component of any digital music synthesizer and the primary focus of this dissertation. Under the title of singing-driven interfaces, we study the design of systems, that based on the singing voice as input, can control the synthesis of musical sounds. From a number of preliminary experiments and studies, we identify the principal issues involved in voice-driven synthesis. We propose one approach for controlling a singing voice synthesizer and another one for controlling the synthesis of other musical instruments. In the former, input and output signals are of the same nature, and control to signal mappings can be direct. In the latter, mappings become more complex, depending on the phonetics of the input voice and the characteristics of the synthesized instrument sound. For this latter case, we present a study on vocal imitation of instruments showing that these voice signals consist of syllables with musical meaning. Also, we suggest linking the characteristics of voice signals to instrumental gestures, describing these signals as vocal gestures. Within the wide scope of the voice-driven synthesis topic, this dissertation studies the relationship between the human voice and the sound of musical instruments by addressing the automatic description of the voice and the mapping strategies for a meaningful control of the synthesized sounds. The contributions of the thesis include several voice analysis methods for using the voice as a control input: a) a phonetic alignment algorithm based on dynamic programming; b) a segmentation algorithm to isolate vocal gestures; c) a formant tracking algorithm; and d) a breathiness characterization algorithm. We also propose a general framework for defining the mappings from vocal gestures to the synthesizer parameters, which are configured according to the instrumental sound being synthesized. As a way to demonstrate the results obtained, two real-time prototypes are implemented. The first prototype controls the synthesis of a singing voice and the second one is a generic controller for other instrumental sounds.","author":[{"family":"Janer","given":"J."}],"citation-key":"janerSingingdrivenInterfacesSound2008","event-place":"Barcelona","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008]]},"publisher":"Universitat Pompeu Fabra","publisher-place":"Barcelona","title":"Singing-driven Interfaces for Sound Synthesizers","type":"thesis","URL":"http://mtg.upf.edu/files/publications/Tesi_jjaner_2008.pdf"},

Here we examined an individual (L) who experiences time units (i.e., months of the year and hours of the day) as occupying specific spatial locations (January is 30° to the left of midline). This form of time-space synaesthesia has been recently investigated by Smilek et al. (2007) who demonstrated that synaesthetic time-space associations are highly consistent, occur regardless of intention, and can direct spatial attention. We extended this work by showing that for the synaesthete L, her time-space vantage point changes depending on whether the time units are seen or heard. For example, when L sees the word JANUARY, she reports experiencing January on her left side, however when she hears the word ” January” she experiences the month on her right side. L's subjective reports were validated using a spatial cueing paradigm. The names of months were centrally presented followed by targets on the left or right. L was faster at detecting targets in validly cued locations relative to invalidly cued locations both for visually presented cues (January orients attention to the left) and for aurally presented cues (January orients attention to the right). We replicated this difference in visual and aural cueing effects using hour of the day. Our findings support previous research showing that time-space synaesthesia can bias visual spatial attention, and further suggest that for this synaesthete, time-space associations differ depending on whether they are visually or aurally induced.","author":[{"family":"Jarick","given":"Michelle"},{"family":"Dixon","given":"Mike J."},{"family":"Stewart","given":"Mark T."},{"family":"Maxwell","given":"Emily C."},{"family":"Smilek","given":"Daniel"}],"citation-key":"jarickDifferentOutlookTime2009","container-title":"Cortex","DOI":"10.1016/j.cortex.2009.05.014","ISSN":"00109452","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,11]]},"page":"1217–1228","title":"A different outlook on time: Visual and auditory month names elicit different mental vantage points for a time-space synaesthete","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cortex.2009.05.014","volume":"45"},

We used two specific event-related brain potential (ERP) components to investigate music-syntactic processing in children: the ERAN (early right anterior negativity) and the N5. The neural resources underlying these processes have been posited to overlap with those involved in the processing of linguistic syntax. Thus, we expected children with specific language impairment (SLI, which is characterized by deficient processing of linguistic syntax) to demonstrate difficulties with music-syntactic processing. Such difficulties were indeed observed in the neural correlates of music-syntactic processing: neither an ERAN nor an N5 was elicited in children with SLI, whereas both components were evoked in age-matched control children with typical language development. Moreover, the amplitudes of ERAN and N5 were correlated with subtests of a language development test. These data provide evidence for a strong interrelation between the language and the music processing system, thereby setting the ground for possible effects of musical training in SLI therapy.","author":[{"family":"Jentschke","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Koelsch","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Sallat","given":"Stephan"},{"family":"Friederici","given":"Angela D."}],"citation-key":"jentschkeChildrenSpecificLanguage2008","container-title":"Journal of cognitive neuroscience","DOI":"10.1162/jocn.2008.20135","ISSN":"0898-929X","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,11]]},"page":"1940–1951","PMID":"18416683","title":"Children with specific language impairment also show impairment of music-syntactic processing.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/jocn.2008.20135","volume":"20"},

The context availability theory argues that concrete words activate a broader contextual verbal support, which results in faster processing, but do not access a distinct image based system. We used event-related fMRI to detect the brain regions that subserve to the concreteness effect. We found greater activation in the lower right and left parietal lobes, in the left inferior frontal lobe and in the precuneus during encoding of concrete compared to abstract nouns. This makes a single exclusive theory unlikely and rather suggests a combination of both models. Superior encoding of concrete words in the present study may result from (1) greater verbal context resources reflected by the activation of left parietal and frontal associative areas, and (2) the additional activation of a non-verbal, perhaps spatial imagery-based system, in the right parietal lobe.","author":[{"family":"Jessen","given":"F."}],"citation-key":"jessenConcretenessEffectEvidence2000","container-title":"Brain and Language","DOI":"10.1006/brln.2000.2340","ISSN":"0093934X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2000,8]]},"page":"103–112","title":"The Concreteness Effect: Evidence for Dual Coding and Context Availability","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/brln.2000.2340","volume":"74"},
  {"id":"johnson-lairdMentalModelsCognitive1986","abstract":"_Mental Models_ offers nothing less than a unified theory of the majorproperties of mind: comprehension, inference, and consciousness. In spiritedand graceful prose, Johnson-Laird argues that we apprehend the world bybuilding inner mental replicas of the relations among objects and events thatconcern us. The mind is essentially a model-building device that can itself bemodeled on a digital computer. This book provides both a blueprint forbuilding such a model and numerous important illustrations of how to do it.In several key areas of cognition, Johnson-Laird shows how an explanationbased on mental modeling is clearly superior to previous theory. For example,he argues compellingly that deductive reasoning does not take place by tacitlyapplying the rules of logic, but by mentally manipulating models of the statesof affairs from which inferences are drawn. Similarly, linguisticcomprehension is best understood not as a matter of applying inference rulesto propositions derived from sentences, but rather as the mind's effort toconstruct and update a model of the situation described by a text or adiscourse. Most provocative, perhaps, is Johnson-Laird's theory ofconsciousness: the mind's necessarily incomplete model of itself allows only apartial control over the many unconscious and parallel processes of cognition.This an extraordinarily rich book, providing a coherent account of much recentexperimental work in cognitive psychology, along with lucid explanations ofrelevant theory in linguistics, computer science, and philosophy Not sinceMiller, Galanter, and Pribram's classic _Plans and the Structure of Behavior_has a book in cognitive science combined such sweep, style, and good sense.Like its distinguished predecessor, _Mental Models_ may well serve to fix apoint of view for a generation.","author":[{"family":"Johnson-Laird","given":"Philip"}],"citation-key":"johnson-lairdMentalModelsCognitive1986","ISBN":"0-674-56882-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[1986,6]]},"note":"Published: Paperback","publisher":"Harvard University Press","title":"Mental Models: Towards a Cognitive Science of Language, Inference, and Consciousness (Cognitive Science Series)","type":"book","URL":"http://www.worldcat.org/isbn/0674568826"},

Two explanations have been provided: (1) a congenital explanation: we are all born as synaesthetes but most of us subsequently lose the experience due to brain development; (2) a learning explanation: synaesthesia is related to some learning process during childhood. Three recent studies provide conflicting support for these explanations. Two studies supported the idea that synaesthesia is learned by showing that the frequency of everyday language implicitly modulates the synaesthetic experience. Another study argued that synaesthesia reflects basic, innate magnitude representations. In this paper we reassess these points of view, and show that it is possible for both to be valid. These findings are integrated into an interactive specialization account of development in order to explain the neuronal mechanism underlying synaesthesia.","author":[{"family":"Kadosh","given":"Roi C."},{"family":"Henik","given":"Avishai"},{"family":"Walsh","given":"Vincent"}],"citation-key":"kadoshSynaesthesiaLearnedLost2009","container-title":"Developmental Science","DOI":"10.1111/j.1467-7687.2008.00798.x","ISSN":"1363-755X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"page":"484–491","PMID":"19371373","title":"Synaesthesia: learned or lost?","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-7687.2008.00798.x","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"kieferLiveCodingMachine2019","abstract":"The MIMIC (Musically Intelligent Machines Interacting Creatively) project explores how the techniques of machine learning and machine listening can be communicated and implemented in simple terms for composers, instrument makers and performers. The potential for machine learning to support musical composition and performance is high, and with novel techniques in machine listening, we see emerging a technology that can shift from being instrumental to conversational and collaborative. By leveraging the internet as a live software ecosystem, the MIMIC project explores how such technology can best reach artists, and live up to its collaborative potential to fundamentally change creative practice in the field.\n    The project involves creating a high level language that can be used for live coding, creative coding and quick prototyping. Implementing a language that interfaces with technically complex problems such as the design of machine learning neural networks or the temporal and spectral algorithms applied in machine listening is not a simple task, but we can build upon decades of research and practice in programming language design (Ko 2016), and computer music language design in particular, as well as a plethora of inventive new approaches in the design of live coding systems for music (Reina et al. 2019).  The language and user interface design will build on recent research in creative coding and interactive machine learning, exemplified by the Rapid Mix project (Bernardo et. al., 2016, Zbyszynski et. al., 2017). Machine learning continues to be at the forefront of new innovations in computer music, (e.g. new sound synthesis techniques in NSynth (Engel et. al. 2017) and WaveNet (van den Oord, 2016));  the language will seek to integrate models based around these new techniques into live coding performance, and also explore the efficacy of live coding as an approach to training and exploiting these systems for analysing and generating sound.\n    Existing live coding systems and languages are often reported on, describing clever solutions as well as weaknesses, as given, for example, in accounts of the development of Tidal (McLean, 2014), Extramuros (Ogborn et. al, 2015) and Gibber (Roberts and Kuchera-Morin, 2012). Researchers are typically reflective and openly critical of their own systems when analysing them and often report on its design with wider implications (Aaron 2011; Sorensen 2018). However, they rarely speculate freely and uninhibitedly about possible solutions or alternative paths taken; the focus is typically on the system described. Before defining the design of our own system, we were therefore interested in opening up a channel where we could learn from other practitioners in language design, machine learning and machine listening. We created a survey that we sent out to relevant communities of practice - such as live coding, machine learning, machine listening, creative coding, deep learning - and asked open questions about how they might imagine a future system implemented, given the knowledge we have today.

The sounds were either triggered by participants' taps or controlled by a computer. The task was to distinguish between self-control and external control during active tapping, and during passive listening to a playback of the sounds recorded during the active condition. Experiment 1 required detection of a change in control mode within trials. Experiments 2 and 3 introduced a simple rhythm reproduction task that requires discrimination of control modes between trials. The results demonstrate that both sensorimotor cues and perceptual cues are used to infer agency. In addition, there may be further influences of cognitive expectation and/or multimodal integration.

  {"id":"koelschMusicLanguageMeaning2004","abstract":"Semantics is a key feature of language, but whether or not music can activate brain mechanisms related to the processing of semantic meaning is not known. We compared processing of semantic meaning in language and music, investigating the semantic priming effect as indexed by behavioral measures and by the N400 component of the event-related brain potential (ERP) measured by electroencephalography (EEG). Human subjects were presented visually with target words after hearing either a spoken sentence or a musical excerpt. Target words that were semantically unrelated to prime sentences elicited a larger N400 than did target words that were preceded by semantically related sentences. In addition, target words that were preceded by semantically unrelated musical primes showed a similar N400 effect, as compared to target words preceded by related musical primes. The N400 priming effect did not differ between language and music with respect to time course, strength or neural generators. Our results indicate that both music and language can prime the meaning of a word, and that music can, as language, determine physiological indices of semantic processing.","author":[{"family":"Koelsch","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Kasper","given":"Elisabeth"},{"family":"Sammler","given":"Daniela"},{"family":"Schulze","given":"Katrin"},{"family":"Gunter","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Friederici","given":"Angela D."}],"citation-key":"koelschMusicLanguageMeaning2004","container-title":"Nature Neuroscience","DOI":"10.1038/nn1197","ISSN":"1097-6256","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,2]]},"page":"302–307","PMID":"14983184","title":"Music, language and meaning: brain signatures of semantic processing","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nn1197","volume":"7"},

This stands in contrast to the prevailing mainstream HCI paradigm, which we term the ‘interaction’ perspective. The ‘practice turn’, as it has been dubbed in the social sciences, provides a conceptual frame to organize a variety of issues emerging in more recent HCI research. While this approach has been present in certain strands of HCI research for some time, it has not been articulated fully to date. In this paper, we provide a short account of the main tenets of this perspective, and then show how it can illuminate some of the recent debates within HCI. Our argument is one which does not seek to replace extant HCI theories, but rather to provide an alternative, complementary theoretical lens which may illuminate the present confusion among both researchers and practitioners as to the direction of HCI. The paper articulates a set of issues which can help direct HCI research programs, as well as highlighting the potential contribution of the HCI field to this practice approach itself, in terms of a more nuanced understanding of emerging practices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Kuutti","given":"Kari"},{"family":"Bannon","given":"Liam J."}],"citation-key":"kuuttiTurnPracticeHCI2014","container-title":"Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","DOI":"10.1145/2556288.2557111","event":"CHI '14: CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","event-place":"Toronto Ontario Canada","ISBN":"978-1-4503-2473-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,4,26]]},"language":"en","page":"3543-3552","publisher":"ACM","publisher-place":"Toronto Ontario Canada","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The turn to practice in HCI: towards a research agenda","title-short":"The turn to practice in HCI","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2556288.2557111"},

  {"id":"lahavActionRepresentationSound2007","abstract":"The discovery of audiovisual mirror neurons in monkeys gave rise to the hypothesis that premotor areas are inherently involved not only when observing actions but also when listening to action-related sound. However, the whole-brain functional formation underlying such \"action-listening\" is not fully understood. In addition, previous studies in humans have focused mostly on relatively simple and overexperienced everyday actions, such as hand clapping or door knocking. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to ask whether the human action-recognition system responds to sounds found in a more complex sequence of newly acquired actions. To address this, we chose a piece of music as a model set of acoustically presentable actions and trained non-musicians to play it by ear. We then monitored brain activity in subjects while they listened to the newly acquired piece. Although subjects listened to the music without performing any movements, activation was found bilaterally in the frontoparietal motor-related network (including Broca's area, the premotor region, the intraparietal sulcus, and the inferior parietal region), consistent with neural circuits that have been associated with action observations, and may constitute the human mirror neuron system. Presentation of the practiced notes in a different order activated the network to a much lesser degree, whereas listening to an equally familiar but motorically unknown music did not activate this network. These findings support the hypothesis of a \"hearing-doing\" system that is highly dependent on the individual's motor repertoire, gets established rapidly, and consists of Broca's area as its hub.","author":[{"family":"Lahav","given":"Amir"},{"family":"Saltzman","given":"Elliot"},{"family":"Schlaug","given":"Gottfried"}],"citation-key":"lahavActionRepresentationSound2007","container-title":"The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","DOI":"10.1523/jneurosci.4822","ISSN":"1529-2401","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,1]]},"page":"308–314","PMID":"17215391","title":"Action representation of sound: audiomotor recognition network while listening to newly acquired actions.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.4822","volume":"27"},
  {"id":"lairdPhysicalModellingDrums2001","abstract":"In this thesis the physical modelling of percussive drums was approached using digital waveguides. The constituent components of a drum were considered individually before connecting them together to complete the model. To model the drumskin techniques were created to incorporate smooth curved boundaries, calculate the impedance of a 2D waveguide mesh and include the effect of the bearing edge. The accuracy of the curved boundary model, which utilised 'rimguides', was demonstrated with a good reproduction of the first seven resonant modes of a circular membrane. The impedance was used in a kettledrum model where it correctly controlled the exchange of energy between the drumskin and interior air. Simulations of different bearing edge sizes revealed that a blunt edge takes energy from low frequencies and redistributes it into higher frequencies. These decay faster and so the result is a decrease in sustain. For the interior air it was necessary to correctly model 3D wave propagation and incorporate diffuse reflections, which occur at rough surfaces. Unlike 3D meshes used in previous studies, the new dodecahedral mesh proposed here was found to exhibit near direction independent dispersion error. The effect of diffusion was adequately simulated with a technique that was shown to be controllable, enabling different types of surface to be modelled. To complete the drum model a way of connecting different waveguide meshes together was found and a new procedure for modelling a mallet exciter was proposed. The interfacing method enabled a lossless interconnection between two 2D meshes and also 2D and 3D meshes. The procedure used for the mallet exciter incorporated non-linear stiffness and the mallet's contact area. Its behaviour was shown to be almost identical to that of a real mallet. Finally, a digital waveguide model of a kettledrum was constructed to demonstrate the techniques and the results were promising; the resonant modes were reproduced with good accuracy and their decay was sufficient to give the impression of realism, whilst not exactly matching that found through measurement.","author":[{"family":"Laird","given":"Joel A."}],"citation-key":"lairdPhysicalModellingDrums2001","issued":{"date-parts":[[2001,11]]},"publisher":"University of Bristol","title":"The Physical Modelling of Drums using Digital Waveguides","type":"thesis"},

  {"id":"lakoffPhilosophyFleshEmbodied1999","abstract":"George Lakoff and Mark Johnson take on the daunting task of rebuilding Western philosophy in alignment with three fundamental lessons from cognitive science: The mind is inherently embodied, thought is mostly unconscious, and abstract concepts are largely metaphorical. Why so daunting? \"Cognitive science–the empirical study of the mind–calls upon us to create a new, empirically responsible philosophy, a philosophy consistent with empirical discoveries about the nature of mind,\" they write. \"A serious appreciation of cognitive science requires us to rethink philosophy from the beginning, in a way that would put it more in touch with the reality of how we think.\" In other words, no Platonic forms, no Cartesian mind-body duality, no Kantian pure logic. Even Noam Chomsky's generative linguistics is revealed under scrutiny to have substantial problems.<p> Parts of <I>Philosophy in the Flesh</I> retrace the ground covered in the authors' earlier <i>Metaphors We Live By</i>, which revealed how we deal with abstract concepts through metaphor. (The previous sentence, for example, relies on the metaphors \"Knowledge is a place\" and \"Knowing is seeing\" to make its point.) Here they reveal the metaphorical underpinnings of basic philosophical concepts like time, causality–even morality–demonstrating how these metaphors are rooted in our embodied experiences. They repropose philosophy as an attempt to perfect such conceptual metaphors so that we can understand how our thought processes shape our experience; they even make a tentative effort toward rescuing spirituality from the heavy blows dealt by the disproving of the disembodied mind or \"soul\" by reimagining \"transcendence\" as \"imaginative empathetic projection.\" Their source list is helpfully arranged by subject matter, making it easier to follow up on their citations. If you enjoyed the mental workout from Steven Pinker's <i>How the Mind Works</i>, Lakoff and Johnson will, to pursue the \"Learning is exercise\" metaphor, take you to the next level of training. <I>–Ron Hogan</I> Two leading thinkers offer a blueprint for a new philosophy. <P>\"Their ambition is massive, their argument important.…The authors engage in a sort of metaphorical genome project, attempting to delineate the genetic code of human thought.\" -The New York Times Book Review <P>\"This book will be an instant academic best-seller.\" -Mark Turner, University of Maryland <P>This is philosophy as it has never been seen before.

  {"id":"larsonMusicalForcesMelodic2004","abstract":"Recent work on musical forces asserts that experienced listeners of tonal music not only talk about music in terms used to describe physical motion, but actually experience musical motion as if it were shaped by quantifiable analogues of physical gravity, magnetism, and inertia. This article presents a theory of melodic expectation based on that assertion, describes two computer models of aspects of that theory, and finds strong support for that theory in comparisons of the behavior of those models with the behavior of participants in several experiments. The following summary statement of the theory is explained and illustrated in the article: Experienced listeners of tonal music expect completions in which the musical forces of gravity, magnetism, and inertia control operations on alphabets in hierarchies of embellishment whose stepwise displacements of auralized traces create simple closed shapes.A single-level computer program models the operation of these musical forces on a single level of musical structure. Given a melodic beginning in a certain key, the model not only produces almost the same responses as experimental participants, but it also rates them in a similar way; the computer model gives higher ratings to responses that participants sing more often. In fact, the completions generated by this model match note-for-note the entire completions sung by participants in several psychological studies as often as the completions of any one of those participants matches those of the other participants.A multilevel computer program models the operation of these musical forces on multiple hierarchical levels. When the multilevel model is given a melodic beginning and a hierarchical description of its embellishment structure (i.e., a Schenkerian analysis of it), the model produces responses that reflect the operation of musical forces on all the levels of that hierarchical structure.Statistical analyses of the results of a number of experiments test hypotheses arising from the computer models algorithm (S. Larson, 1993a) for the interaction of musical forces as well as from F. Lerdahls similar (1996) algorithm. Further statistical analysis contrasts the explanatory power of the theory of musical forces with that of E. Narmours (1990, 1992) implication-realization model.The striking agreement between computer-generated responses and experimental results suggests that the theory captures some important aspects of melodic expectation. Furthermore, the fact that these data can be modeled well by the interaction of constantly acting but contextually determined musical forces gives support to the idea that we experience musical motions metaphorically in terms of our experience of physical motions.","author":[{"family":"Larson","given":"S."}],"citation-key":"larsonMusicalForcesMelodic2004","container-title":"Music Perception","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004]]},"page":"457–498","title":"Musical forces and melodic expectations: Comparing computer models with experimental results","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://caliber.ucpress.net/doi/abs/10.1525/mp.2004.21.4.457","volume":"21"},

This systematic effort of building a new philosophical anthropology presents a completely different view of what Moderns have been, and provides a new basis for opening diplomatic encounters with other societies at a time when all societies are coping with ecological crisis.","author":[{"family":"Latour","given":"Bruno"},{"family":"Porter","given":"Catherine"}],"citation-key":"latourInquiryModesExistence2013a","event-place":"Cambridge, Massachusetts","ISBN":"978-0-674-72499-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,8,16]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"520","publisher":"Harvard University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, Massachusetts","source":"Amazon","title":"An Inquiry Into Modes of Existence: An Anthropology of the Moderns","title-short":"An Inquiry Into Modes of Existence","type":"book"},

His work spans some sixty years and includes original work on a diverse range of subjects, from dialectical materialism to architecture, urbanism and the experience of everyday life. The Production of Space is his major philosophical work and its translation has been long awaited by scholars in many different fields. The book is a search for reconciliation between mental space (the space of the philosophers) and real space (the physical and social spheres in which we all live). In the course of his exploration, Henri Lefebvre moves from metaphysical and ideological considerations of the meaning of space to its experience in the everyday life of home and city. He seeks, in other words, to bridge the gap between the realms of theory and practice, between the mental and the social, and between philosophy and reality. In doing so, he ranges through art, literature, architecture and economics, and further provides a powerful antidote to the sterile and obfuscatory methods and theories characteristic of much recent continental philosophy. This is a work of great vision and incisiveness. It is also characterized by its author's wit and by anecdote, as well as by a deftness of style that Donald Nicholson-Smith's sensitive translation precisely captures.","author":[{"family":"Lefebvre","given":"Henri"}],"citation-key":"lefebvreProductionSpace1992","edition":"1","ISBN":"0-631-18177-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[1992,4]]},"note":"Published: Paperback","publisher":"Wiley-Blackwell","title":"The Production of Space","type":"book","URL":"http://www.worldcat.org/isbn/0631181776"},

  {"id":"lemanEmbodiedMusicCognition2007","abstract":"Digital media handles music as encoded physical energy, but humans consider music in terms of beliefs, intentions, interpretations, experiences, evaluations, and significations. In this book, drawing on work in computer science, psychology, brain science, and musicology, Marc Leman proposes an embodied cognition approach to music research that will help bridge this gap. Assuming that the body plays a central role in all musical activities, and basing his approach on a hypothesis about the relationship between musical experience (mind) and sound energy (matter), Leman proposes that the human body is a biologically designed mediator that transfers physical energy to a mental level–engaging experiences, values, and intentions–and, reversing the process, transfers mental representation into material form. He suggests that this idea of the body as mediator offers a promising framework for thinking about music mediation technology. Leman argues that, under certain conditions, the natural mediator (the body) can be extended with artificial technology-based mediators. He explores the necessary conditions and analyzes ways in which they can be studied.<br /> <br /> Leman outlines his theory of embodied music cognition, introducing a model that describes the relationship between a human subject and its environment, analyzing the coupling of action and perception, and exploring different degrees of the body's engagement with music. He then examines possible applications in two core areas: interaction with music instruments and music search and retrieval in a database or digital library. The embodied music cognition approach, Leman argues, can help us develop tools that integrate artistic expression and contemporary technology.","author":[{"family":"Leman","given":"Marc"}],"citation-key":"lemanEmbodiedMusicCognition2007","ISBN":"0-262-12293-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,9]]},"note":"Published: Hardcover","publisher":"The MIT Press","title":"Embodied Music Cognition and Mediation Technology","type":"book","URL":"http://www.worldcat.org/isbn/0262122936"},

It is not in the nature of cyberspace to be unregulable; cyberspace has no \"nature.\" It only has code-the software and hardware that make cyberspace what it is. That code can create a place of freedom-as the original architecture of the Net did-or a place of oppressive control. Under the influence of commerce, cyberpsace is becoming a highly regulable space, where behavior is much more tightly controlled than in real space. But that's not inevitable either. We can-we must-choose what kind of cyberspace we want and what freedoms we will guarantee. These choices are all about architecture: about what kind of code will govern cyberspace, and who will control it. In this realm, code is the most significant form of law, and it is up to lawyers, policymakers, and especially citizens to decide what values that code embodies. <P> Since its original publication, this seminal book has earned the status of a minor classic.

  {"id":"leveltModelsWordProduction1999","abstract":"Research on spoken word production has been approached from two angles. In one research tradition, the analysis of spontaneous or induced speech errors led to models that can account for speech error distributions. In another tradition, the measurement of picture naming latencies led to chronometric models accounting for distributions of reaction times in word production. Both kinds of models are, however, dealing with the same underlying processes: (1) the speaker's selection of a word that is semantically and syntactically appropriate; (2) the retrieval of the word's phonological properties; (3) the rapid syllabification of the word in context; and (4) the preparation of the corresponding articulatory gestures. Models of both traditions explain these processes in terms of activation spreading through a localist, symbolic network. By and large, they share the main levels of representation: conceptual/semantic, syntactic, phonological and phonetic. They differ in various details, such as the amount of cascading and feedback in the network. These research traditions have begun to merge in recent years, leading to highly constructive experimentation. Currently, they are like two similar knives honing each other. A single pair of scissors is in the making.","author":[{"family":"Levelt","given":"Willem J.

  {"id":"levyHackersHeroesComputer2002","abstract":"Steven Levy's classic book explains why the misuse of the word \"hackers\" to describe computer criminals does a terrible disservice to many important shapers of the digital revolution. Levy follows members of an MIT model railroad club–a group of brilliant budding electrical engineers and computer innovators–from the late 1950s to the mid-1980s. These eccentric characters used the term \"hack\" to describe a clever way of improving the electronic system that ran their massive railroad. And as they started designing clever ways to improve computer systems, \"hack\" moved over with them. These maverick characters were often fanatics who did not always restrict themselves to the letter of the law and who devoted themselves to what became known as \"The Hacker Ethic.\" The book traces the history of hackers, from finagling access to clunky computer-card-punching machines to uncovering the inner secrets of what would become the Internet. This story of brilliant, eccentric, flawed, and often funny people devoted to their dream of a better world will appeal to a wide audience. Today, technology is cool. Owning the most powerful computer, the latest high-tech gadget, and the whizziest web site is a status symbol on a par with having a flashy car or a designer suit. And a media obsessed with the digital explosion has reappropriated the term \"computer nerd\" so that it's practically synonymous with \"entrepreneur.\" Yet, a mere fifteen years ago, wireheads hooked on tweaking endless lines of code were seen as marginal weirdos, outsiders whose world would never resonate with the mainstream. That was before one pioneering work documented the underground computer revolution that was about to change our world forever. With groundbreaking profiles of Bill Gates, Steve Wozniak, MIT's tech Model Railroad Club, and more, Steven Levy's <i>Hackers</i> brilliantly captures a seminal moment when the risk takers and explorers were poised to conquer twentieth-century America's last great frontier. And in the Internet age, \"the hacker ethic\"–first espoused here–is alive an well.","author":[{"family":"Levy","given":"Steven"}],"citation-key":"levyHackersHeroesComputer2002","ISBN":"0-14-100051-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002,1]]},"note":"Published: Paperback","publisher":"Penguin Putnam","title":"Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution","type":"book","URL":"http://www.worldcat.org/isbn/0141000511"},

According to the revised theory, phonetic information is perceived in a biologically distinct system, a 'module' specialized to detect the intended gestures of the speaker that are the basis for phonetic categories. Built into the structure of this module is the unique but lawful relationship between the gestures and the acoustic patterns in which they are variously overlapped. In consequence, the module causes perception of phonetic structure without translation from preliminary auditory impressions. Thus, it is comparable to such other modules as the one that enables an animal to localize sound. Peculiar to the phonetic module are the relation between perception and production it incorporates and the fact that it must compete with other modules for the same stimulus variations.","author":[{"family":"Liberman","given":"Alvin M."},{"family":"Mattingly","given":"Ignatius G."}],"citation-key":"libermanMotorTheorySpeech1985","container-title":"Cognition","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1985]]},"page":"1–36","title":"The motor theory of speech perception revised","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0010-0277(85)90021-6","volume":"21"},

Accordingly, the primary motor and perceptual representations are inappropriate for linguistic purposes until a cognitive process of some sort has connected them to language and to each other. The less conventional theory takes the speech elements to be articulatory gestures that are the primary objects of both production and perception. Those gestures form a natural class that serves a linguistic function and no other. Therefore, their representations are immediately linguistic, requiring no cognitive intervention to make them appropriate for use by the other components of the language system. The unconventional view provides the more plausible answers to three important questions: (1) How was the necessary parity between speaker and listener established in evolution, and how maintained? (2) How does speech meet the special requirements that underlie its ability, unique among natural communication systems, to encode an indefinitely large number of meanings?

British English is commonly described as stress-timed, but Singapore English is claimed to be syllable-timed. In the present paper, we explore the acoustic nature of the suggested cross-varietal difference. In directly comparable samples from British English and Singapore English, two types of acoustic measurements were taken; we calculated a variability index reflecting changes in vowel length over utterances, and measurements reflecting vowel quality. Our findings provide acoustic data which support the hypothesized cross-varietal difference in rhythmic patterning; we show (1) that successive vowel durations are more nearly equal in Singapore English than in British English, and (2) that reduced vowels pattern more peripherally in the F1/F2 formant space in Singapore English than in British English. We complete the paper with a comparison of our vowel variability index with a set of acoustic measures for rhythm proposed by Ramus, Nespor, and Mehler (1999), which focus on variability in vocalic and intervocalic intervals. We conclude that our variability index is more successful in capturing rhythmic differences than Ramus et al. (1999)'s measures, and that an application of our index to Ramus et al.'s intervocalic measure may provide a further diagnostic of rhythmic class.","author":[{"family":"Ling","given":"L.

  {"id":"listerMultinationalStudyReading2004","abstract":"A study by a ITiCSE 2001 working group (\"the McCracken Group\") established that many students do not know how to program at the conclusion of their introductory courses. A popular explanation for this incapacity is that the students lack the ability to problem-solve. That is, they lack the ability to take a problem description, decompose it into sub-problems and implement them, then assemble the pieces into a complete solution. An alternative explanation is that many students have a fragile grasp of both basic programming principles and the ability to systematically carry out routine programming tasks, such as tracing (or \"desk checking\") through code. This ITiCSE 2004 working group studied the alternative explanation, by testing students from seven countries, in two ways.

  {"id":"londonHearingTimePsychological2004","abstract":"Our sense that a waltz is \"in three\" or a blues song is \"in four with a shuffle\" comes from our sense of musical meter. Hearing in Time explores musical meter from the point of view of cognitive theories of perception and attention. London explores how our ability to follow musical meter is simply a specific instance of our more general ability to synchronize our attention to regularly recurring events in our environment. As such, musical meter is subject to a number of fundamental perceptual and cognitive constraints, which form the cornerstones of London's account. Because listening to music, like many other rhythmic activities, is something that we often do, London views it as a skilled activity for performers and non-performers alike. Hearing in Time approaches musical meter in the context of music as it is actually performed, rather than as a theoretical ideal. Its approach is not based on any particular musical style or cultural practice, so it uses familiar examples from a broad range of music–Beethoven and Bach to Brubeck and Ghanaian drumming. Taking this broad approach brings out a number of fundamental similarities between a variety of different metric phenomena, such as the difference between so-called simple versus complex or additive meters. Because of its accessible style–only a modest ability to read a musical score is presumed–Hearing in Time is for anyone interested in rhythm and meter, including cognitive psychologists, musicologists, musicians, and music theorists.","author":[{"family":"London","given":"Justin"}],"citation-key":"londonHearingTimePsychological2004","ISBN":"0-19-516081-9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,9]]},"note":"Published: Hardcover","publisher":"Oxford University Press, USA","title":"Hearing in Time: Psychological Aspects of Musical Meter","type":"book","URL":"http://www.worldcat.org/isbn/0195160819"},

  {"id":"magnussonEpistemicToolsMusical2009","abstract":"This paper explores the differences in the design and performance of acoustic and new digital musical instruments, arguing that with the latter there is an increased encapsulation of musical theory. The point of departure is the phenomenology of musical instruments, which leads to the exploration of designed artefacts as extensions of human cognition – as scaffolding onto which we delegate parts of our cognitive processes. The paper succinctly emphasises the pronounced epistemic dimension of digital instruments when compared to acoustic instruments. Through the analysis of material epistemologies it is possible to describe the digital instrument as an epistemic tool: a designed tool with such a high degree of symbolic pertinence that it becomes a system of knowledge and thinking in its own terms. In conclusion, the paper rounds up the phenomenological and epistemological arguments, and points at issues in the design of digital musical instruments that are germane due to their strong aesthetic implications for musical culture.","author":[{"family":"Magnusson","given":"Thor"}],"citation-key":"magnussonEpistemicToolsMusical2009","container-title":"Organised Sound","DOI":"10.1017/s1355771809000272","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"page":"168–176","title":"Of Epistemic Tools: musical instruments as cognitive extensions","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s1355771809000272","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"magnussonEpistemicToolsPhenomenology2009","abstract":"Digital music technologies, and instruments in particular, are the result of specific systems of thought that define and enframe the user’s creative options. Distinctive divisions between digital and acoustic instruments can be traced, contrasting the conceptually based design of software with the affordances and constraints of physical artefacts. Having lost the world’s gift of physical properties, the digital instrument builder becomes more than a mere luthier. The process of designing and building the instrument is transformed into a process of composition, for it typically contains a greater degree of classification and music theory than its acoustic counterpart.\n\nPart I of this thesis begins by framing musical systems in the context of the philosophy of technology. Here technological conditions are questioned and theories introduced that will assist the investigation into the relationship between creativity and technology. After this general grounding, the ramifications digital technologies pose to the human body are explored in the context of human expression through tool use. The human-machine relationship is described from phenomenological perspectives and relevant theories of cognitive science. This analysis serves as a foundation for the concept of epistemic tools, defined as the mechanism whereby techno-cultural models are inscribed into technological artefacts. The cultural element of tool use and tool origins is therefore emphasised, an aspect that is highly relevant in musical technologies. Part I thus frames the material properties of acoustic and digital instruments in relation to human culture, cognition, performance and epistemology.\n\nPart II contextualises these theories in practice. The ixiQuarks, the live improvisation musical environment that resulted from the current research, are presented as a system addressing some of the vital problems of musical performance with digital systems (such as the question of embodiment and theoretical inscriptions), proposing an innovative interaction model for screen-based musical instruments. The concept of virtual embodiment is introduced and framed in the context of the ixi interaction model. Two extensive user studies are described that support the report on ixiQuarks. Furthermore, comparative surveys on the relationship between expression and technology are presented: a) the phenomenology of musical instruments, where the divergence between the acoustic and the digital is investigated; b) the question of expressive freedom versus time constraints in musical environments is explored with practitioners in the field; and c) the key players in the design of audio programming environments explain the rationale and philosophy behind their work. These are the first major surveys of this type conducted to date, and the results interweave smoothly with the observations and findings in the chapters on the nature and the design of digital instruments that make up the majority of Part II.\n\nThis interdisciplinary research investigates the nature of making creative tools in the digital realm, through an active, philosophically framed and ethnographically inspired study, of both practical and theoretical engagement. It questions the nature of digital musical instruments, particularly in comparison with acoustic instruments. Through a survey of material epistemologies, the dichotomy between the acoustic and the digital is employed to illustrate the epistemic nature of digital artefacts, necessitating a theory of epistemic tools. Consequently virtual embodiment is presented as a definition of the specific interaction mode constituting human relations with digital technologies. It is demonstrated that such interactions are indeed embodied, contrasting common claims that interaction with software is a disembodied activity. The role of cultural context in such design is emphasised, through an analysis of how system design is always an intricate process of analyses, categorisations, normalisations, abstractions, and constructions; where the design paths taken are often defined by highly personal, culturally conditioned and often arbitrary reasons.\n\nThe dissertation therefore dissects the digital musical instrument from the perspectives of ontology, phenomenology and epistemology. Respective sections in Part I and Part II deal with these views. The practical outcome of this research – the ixiQuarks – embodies many of the theoretical points made on these pages. The software itself, together with the theoretical elucidation of its context, should therefore be viewed as equal contributions to the field of music technology. The thesis closes by considering what has been achieved through these investigations of the technological context, software development, user studies, surveys, and the phenomenological and epistemological enquiries into the realities of digital musical instruments, emphasising that technology can never be neutral.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Magnusson","given":"Thor"}],"citation-key":"magnussonEpistemicToolsPhenomenology2009","genre":"doctoral","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,5,1]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"407","publisher":"University of Sussex","source":"sro.sussex.ac.uk","title":"Epistemic tools: the phenomenology of digital musical instruments","title-short":"Epistemic tools","type":"thesis","URL":"http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/83540/"},

  {"id":"mayoMultidimensionalScalingListener2005","abstract":"The move to unit-selection in speech synthesis has resulted in system improvements being made at subtle sub- and suprasegmental levels. Human perceptual evaluation of such subtle improvements requires a highly sophisticated level of perceptual attention to specific acoustic characteristics or cues. However, it is not well understood what acoustic cues listeners attend to by default when asked to evaluate synthetic speech. It may, therefore, be potentially quite difficult to design an evaluation method that allows listeners to concentrate on only one dimension of the signal, while ignoring others that are perceptually more important to them. This paper describes a pilot study which aims to evaluate multidimensional scaling (MDS) as a possible method of determining what acoustic characteristics of synthetic speech influence listeners' judgements of the naturalness of the speech. Using distance measures (either real or perceived distances), MDS techniques represent stimuli as points in n-dimensional space. The space is configured so that similar stimuli are close together, while different stimuli are farther apart. Additionally, the dimensions of the space correspond to characteristics of the stimuli which influenced the perceived distances. Our results indicate that MDS techniques should be a useful tool in understanding the complex psychoacoustic processes that listeners undergo when evaluating synthetic speech. This method has allowed us to identify a number of cues that appear to be particularly perceptually salient to listeners evaluating synthetic speech naturalness, namely prosodic cues (in terms of duration and/or intonation) and segmental or unit level cues (in terms of appropriateness of units, or number of units).","author":[{"family":"Mayo","given":"Catherine"},{"family":"Clark","given":"Robert A.

For Colman and McCrea, 'the maypole expresses the network’s torsion balance chart of power. The maypole topology is order through rhythmic tension and torsion, and in this sense its continuous binding of power makes the concept the paradoxical apostate of the network’s labyrinthine structure. The instinctual and biological ties of the etymological maypole enable us to focus upon specific power combinations of the network’s prescience'.

However, speech perception is normally regarded as a purely auditory process. The study reported here demonstrates a previously unrecognised influence of vision upon speech perception. It stems from an observation that, on being shown a film of a young woman's talking head, in which repeated utterances of the syllable [ba] had been dubbed on to lip movements for [ga], normal adults reported hearing [da]. With the reverse dubbing process, a majority reported hearing [bagba] or [gaba]. When these subjects listened to the soundtrack from the film, without visual input, or when they watched untreated film, they reported the syllables accurately as repetitions of [ba] or [ga]. Subsequent replications confirm the reliability of these findings; they have important implications for the understanding of speech perception.","author":[{"family":"McGurk","given":"H."},{"family":"MacDonald","given":"J.

  {"id":"mcleanAlgorithmicPattern2020a","abstract":"This paper brings together two main perspectives on algorithmic pattern. First, the writing of musical patterns in live coding performance, and second, the weaving of patterns in textiles. In both cases, algorithmic pattern is an interface between the human and the outcome, where small changes have far-reaching impact on the results. By bringing contemporary live coding and ancient textile approaches together, we reach a common view of pattern as algorithmic movement (e.g. looping, shifting, reflecting, interfering) in the making of things. This works beyond the usual definition of pattern used in musical interfaces, of mere repeating sequences. We conclude by considering the place of algorithmic pattern in a wider activity of making.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Mclean","given":"Alex"}],"citation-key":"mcleanAlgorithmicPattern2020a","container-title":"Proceedings of the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression","event":"NIME2020","event-place":"Birmingham, UK","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,1]]},"page":"265--270","publisher-place":"Birmingham, UK","title":"Algorithmic Pattern","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://zenodo.org/record/4813352"},

While AM was using computers from an early age, and began serious programming around 1986 (aged 11), RTD first used a (desktop) computer in around 1982 (already aged more than 30). So in this final Perspective on Practice, we will discuss our own experiences and the development of our current enthusiasms. We hope that brief consideration of these trajectories will have some interest for readers seeking to engage with the breadth of our field of algorithmic music. We drafted our own sections, and then jointly edited the chapter, providing a brief conclusion; we also took advantage of helpful suggestions from external reviewers.

  {"id":"mcleanAlternateTimelinesTidalCycles2021","abstract":"The TidalCycles (or Tidal for short) live coding environment has been developed since around 2009, via several rewrites of its core representation. Rather than having fixed goals, this development has been guided by use, motivated by the open aim to make music. This development process can be seen as a long-form improvisation, with insights into the nature of Tidal gained through the process of writing it, feeding back to guide the next steps of development. This brings the worrying thought that key insights will have been missed along this development journey, that would otherwise have lead to very different software. Indeed participants at beginners’ workshops that I have lead or co-lead have often asked questions without good answers, because they made deficiencies or missing features in the software clear. It is well known that a beginner’s mind is able to see much that an expert has become blind to. Running workshops are an excellent way to find new development ideas, but the present paper explores a different technique – the rewrite.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,17]]},"author":[{"family":"McLean","given":"Alex"}],"citation-key":"mcleanAlternateTimelinesTidalCycles2021","DOI":"10.5281/zenodo.5788732","event-place":"Valdivia, Chile","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,15]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"Zenodo","publisher-place":"Valdivia, Chile","title":"Alternate Timelines for TidalCycles","type":"speech","URL":"https://zenodo.org/record/5788732"},

Behind the graphical user interface we find a text-based one, then a programming language, then a low-level assembly language, then machine and microcode, until we eventually meet with physical electronic circuits. The conventional timeline for computing technology as a whole begins earlier still, with the discovery of the electronic transistor a century ago. Each of these layers has had its heyday as the dominant user interface of its time, and indeed each has been used to make algorithmic systems for, or indeed as, art. There is much artwork to be recognised throughout this period, but if we keep digging, there are many more ruins to be found. Through research during our European Research Council project PENELOPE, we find that algorithms have been present in everyday life for millennia.

It runs on low-powered hardware including the Raspberry Pi Zero, with formative testing of prototypes conducted with several groups of children between the ages of 8 and 14. Feedforward has a number of features designed to support improvised, multi-pattern live coding. Individual Tidal patterns are addressable with hotkeys for fast mute and unmuting. Each pattern has a stereo VU meter, to aid the quick matching of sound to pattern within a mix. In addition, TidalCycles has been extended to store context with each event, so that source code positions in its polyrhythmic sequence mini-notation are tracked. This allows steps to be highlighted in the source code when- ever they are active. This works even when Tidal combinators have been applied to manipulate the timeline. Formal evaluation has yet to take place, but this feature appears to support learning of how pattern manipulations work in Tidal.

Our claim is that, when judging similarity, processes that are obligatory, or what we call mandatory processes, can commingle with processes of choice, or what we call optional processes. By varying instructions, we found strong evidence of optional process- ing. Instructions to rate overall similarity encouraged subjects to attend to stimuli as wholes and led to a Euclidean rule in similarity scaling. Instructionsto focus on-dimensions encouraged subjects to consider each stimulus dimension separately and-led-to-a-city-block rule. We argue that optional processes may obscure mandatory ones, and so need to be identified-before-manda- tory processes can be understood.","author":[{"family":"Melara","given":"Robert D."},{"family":"Marks","given":"Lawrence E."},{"family":"Lesko","given":"Kathryn E."}],"citation-key":"melaraOptionalProcessesSimilarity1992","container-title":"Perception & Psychophysics","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1992]]},"page":"123–133","title":"Optional processes in similarity judgments","type":"article-journal","volume":"51"},

  {"id":"millerPerceptualSpaceMusical1975","abstract":"Individual subjects with or without musical training made similarity judgments of pairs of tones on a nine-point scale. Each subject was run in three or four sessions of 351 trials each. The tones had structures like those of musical instruments, being made of all 27 combinations of three dimensions, each at three levels. In Experiment 1, the dimensions were fundamental frequency F0, envelope, and relative amplitudes of harmonics. In Experiment 2, the dimensions were number of harmonics, envelope, and onset rate of harmonics. Analysis of data by means of multidimensional scaling showed a strong context effect. In Experiment 1, F0 had such high saliency that for most subjects no other dimension was present in perceptual space and thus no differences were found between musical and nonmusical subjects. By holding F0 constant in Experiment 2, subjects were able to use harmonic as well as envelope structure in judgments. Differences between musical and nonmusical subjects appeared, and we discuss the basis for these differences. For both experiments, the curve relating latency of response to similarity was parabolic and, although a given subject's perceptual space changes little over successive runs, there is some evidence from Experiment 2 that musical subjects have the more stable space of perceptual dimensions.Subject Classification: 65.52, 65.75; 75.10. doi:10.1121/1.380719 PACS: 43.65.+v, 43.75.+a Additional Information Full Text: [ PDF (874 kB) GZipped PS","author":[{"family":"Miller","given":"James R."},{"family":"Carterette","given":"Edward C."}],"citation-key":"millerPerceptualSpaceMusical1975","container-title":"The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America","DOI":"10.1121/1.380719","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[1975]]},"page":"711–720","title":"Perceptual space for musical structures","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/1.380719","volume":"58"},
  {"id":"millerRevisionHistoryAware2011","abstract":"Building repositories of computational models of biological systems ensures that published models are available for both education and further research, and can provide a source of smaller, previously verified models to integrate into a larger model. One problem with earlier repositories has been the limitations in facilities to record the revision history of models. Often, these facilities are limited to a linear series of versions which were deposited in the repository. This is problematic for several reasons. Firstly, there are many instances in the history of biological systems modelling where an 'ancestral' model is modified by different groups to create many different models. With a linear series of versions, if the changes made to one model are merged into another model, the merge appears as a single item in the history. This hides useful revision history information, and also makes further merges much more difficult, as there is no record of which changes have or have not already been merged. In addition, a long series of individual changes made outside of the repository are also all merged into a single revision when they are put back into the repository, making it difficult to separate out individual changes. Furthermore, many earlier repositories only retain the revision history of individual files, rather than of a group of files. This is an important limitation to overcome, because some types of models, such as CellML 1.1 models, can be developed as a collection of modules, each in a separate file. The need for revision history is widely recognised for computer software, and a lot of work has gone into developing version control systems and distributed version control systems (DVCSs) for tracking the revision history. However, to date, there has been no published research on how DVCSs can be applied to repositories of computational models of biological systems. We have extended the Physiome Model Repository software to be fully revision history aware, by building it on top of Mercurial, an existing DVCS. We have demonstrated the utility of this approach, when used in conjunction with the model composition facilities in CellML, to build and understand more complex models. We have also demonstrated the ability of the repository software to present version history to casual users over the web, and to highlight specific versions which are likely to be useful to users. Providing facilities for maintaining and using revision history information is an important part of building a useful repository of computational models, as this information is useful both for understanding the source of and justification for parts of a model, and to facilitate automated processes such as merges. The availability of fully revision history aware repositories, and associated tools, will therefore be of significant benefit to the community.","author":[{"family":"Miller","given":"Andrew K."},{"family":"Yu","given":"Tommy"},{"family":"Britten","given":"Randall"},{"family":"Cooling","given":"Mike T."},{"family":"Lawson","given":"James"},{"family":"Cowan","given":"Dougal"},{"family":"Garny","given":"Alan"},{"family":"Halstead","given":"Matt D."},{"family":"Hunter","given":"Peter J."},{"family":"Nickerson","given":"David P."},{"family":"Nunns","given":"Geo"},{"family":"Wimalaratne","given":"Sarala M."},{"family":"Nielsen","given":"Poul M."}],"citation-key":"millerRevisionHistoryAware2011","container-title":"BMC bioinformatics","DOI":"10.1186/1471-2105-12-22","ISSN":"1471-2105","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"page":"22+","PMCID":"PMC3033326","PMID":"21235804","title":"Revision history aware repositories of computational models of biological systems.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-12-22","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"molnar-szakacsMusicMirrorNeurons2006","abstract":"The ability to create and enjoy music is a universal human trait and plays an important role in the daily life of most cultures. Music has a unique ability to trigger memories, awaken emotions and to intensify our social experiences. We do not need to be trained in music performance or appreciation to be able to reap its benefits-already as infants, we relate to it spontaneously and effortlessly. There has been a recent surge in neuroimaging investigations of the neural basis of musical experience, but the way in which the abstract shapes and patterns of musical sound can have such profound meaning to us remains elusive. Here we review recent neuroimaging evidence and suggest that music, like language, involves an intimate coupling between the perception and production of hierarchically organized sequential information, the structure of which has the ability to communicate meaning and emotion. We propose that these aspects of musical experience may be mediated by the human mirror neuron system.","author":[{"family":"Molnar-Szakacs","given":"Istvan"},{"family":"Overy","given":"Katie"}],"citation-key":"molnar-szakacsMusicMirrorNeurons2006","container-title":"Social cognitive and affective neuroscience","ISSN":"1749-5024","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,12]]},"page":"235–241","PMID":"18985111","title":"Music and mirror neurons: from motion to 'e'motion.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18985111","volume":"1"},
  {"id":"monelleSenseMusicSemiotic2000","abstract":"The fictional Dr. Strabismus sets out to write a new comprehensive theory ofmusic. But music's tendency to deconstruct itself combined with thecomplexities of postmodernism doom him to failure. This is the parable thatframes \"The Sense of Music,\" a novel treatment of music theory thatreinterprets the modern history of Western music in the terms of semiotics.Based on the assumption that music cannot be described without reference toits meaning, Raymond Monelle proposes that works of the Western classicaltradition be analyzed in terms of temporality, subjectivity, and topic theory.Critical of the abstract analysis of musical scores, Monelle argues that thescore does not reveal music's \"sense.\" That sense–what a piece of music saysand signifies–can be understood only with reference to history, culture, andthe other arts. Thus, music is meaningful in that it signifies culturaltemporalities and themes, from the traditional manly heroism of the hunt tomilitary power to postmodern \"polyvocality.\" This theoretical innovationallows Monelle to describe how the Classical style of the eighteenth century–which he reads as a balance of lyric and progressive time–gave way to theRomantic need for emotional realism. He argues that irony and ambiguitysubsequently eroded the domination of personal emotion in Western music aswell as literature, killing the composer's subjectivity with that of theauthor. This leaves Dr. Strabismus suffering from the postmodern condition,and Raymond Monelle with an exciting, controversial new approach tounderstanding music and its history.","author":[{"family":"Monelle","given":"Raymond"}],"citation-key":"monelleSenseMusicSemiotic2000","ISBN":"0-691-05715-X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2000,11]]},"note":"Published: Hardcover","publisher":"Princeton University Press","title":"The Sense of Music: Semiotic Essays","type":"book","URL":"http://www.worldcat.org/isbn/069105715X"},

Timbral relationships between word and music can be conceptualized as a continuum following an fictive axis running from meaning and timbre of words, through melody and music to performance. Sometimes the order might be different, but the ingredients will always be there. To get a grip on the totality of timbre and meaning involved in the songs and performances of one single artist, Swedish balladeer Olle Adolphson, a study was conducted along this research design. The interplay between the inherent timbres in vowel sounds and melody were firstly studied in the songs themselves and relationships were noted that showed signs of systematic appearance. Perspectives from these observations were intergrated with analyzes of timbral bearings on meaning and signification in words and musical settings of a number of songs. Following the axis to performance, aspects of timbre were studied with aid of visual representations of the signal as waveforms, melograms and spectograms, verifying observations and as tools for identification and discussion. The study points further towards timbre and emotional cues in vocal performances as signs of individual/enviroment interactions.","author":[{"family":"Mossberg","given":"Frans"}],"citation-key":"mossbergContinuumWordsVoice2005","container-title":"Proceedings of the Conference on Interdisciplinary Musicology 2005","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005]]},"title":"The Continuum of words, voice and music.

Tying our past experiences to our present interactions with the environment, they enable us to recognize and understand new objects and events.

We equipped the humanoid robot with an initial set of motor and perceptual competencies ranging from simple stereotyped actions to more sophisticated visual routines providing a bottom-up attention system. This initial form of sensorimotor coordination is sufficient to initiate the interaction with the environment and allows the robot to improve its motor and perceptual skills by first constructing a \"body-schema\" and later by learning about objects. The body-schema allows controlling movements to fixate, reach and touch objects in the environment. The interaction is further used to form a visual model of the objects grasped by the robot which eventually modulate the attention system in a top-down way. In another experiment we show an initial effort to study the acquisition of object affordances.

Subjects are sometimes (a) unaware of the existence of a stimulus that importantly influenced a response, (b) unaware of the existence of the response, and (c) unaware that the stimulus has affected the response. It is proposed that when people attempt to report on their cognitive processes, that is, on the processes mediating the effects of a stimulus on a response, the do not do so on the basis of any true introspection. Instead, their reports are based on a priori, implicit casual theories or judgments about the extent to which a particular stimulus is a plausible cause of a given response. This suggests that though people may not be able to observe directly their cognitive processes, the will sometimes be able to report accurately about them.

It is the work of the Critical Engineer to study and exploit this language, exposing its influence. The Critical Engineer considers any technology depended upon to be both a challenge and a threat. The greater the dependence on a technology the greater the need to study and expose its inner workings, regardless of ownership or legal provision. The Critical Engineer raises awareness that with each technological advance our techno-political literacy is challenged. The Critical Engineer deconstructs and incites suspicion of rich user experiences. The Critical Engineer looks beyond the 'awe of implementation' to determine methods of influence and their specific effects. The Critical Engineer recognises that each work of engineering engineers its user, proportional to that user's dependency upon it. The Critical Engineer expands 'machine' to describe interrelationships encompassing devices, bodies, agents, forces and networks. The Critical Engineer observes the space between the production and consumption of technology. Acting rapidly to changes in this space, the Critical Engineer serves to expose moments of imbalance and deception. The Critical Engineer looks to the history of art, architecture, activism, philosophy and invention and finds exemplary works of Critical Engineering. Strategies, ideas and agendas from these disciplines will be adopted, re-purposed and deployed. The Critical Engineer notes that written code expands into social and psychological realms, regulating behaviour between people and the machines they interact with.

This handbook brings together dozens of leading researchers and practitioners in the field, blending technical, artistic, cultural and scientific viewpoints into a whole that considers the making of algorithmic music as a rich, and essentially human activity. The book is organised into four sections, the first grounding the topic in the history, philosophy and psychology of algorithmic music. The second section asks 'what can algorithms in music do?', finding answers in computer science, mathematics, machine learning, bio-inspired computation, manipulation of pattern, computational creativity, and live coding. The third section focuses on the music maker, and the role of algorithms in supporting network music, sonification, music interface design, music in computer games, and spatialisation. The final section opens out to culture at large, and considers algorithmic music in terms of its audience reception, sociology, education, politics and the potential for mass consumption. Perhaps just as importantly, these sections are interleaved with reflective pieces from leading practitioners in the field, allowing us to to grasp the pragmatics of making music with algorithms. Combined, these diverse standpoints provide an absorbing, authoritative survey of research and practice from across the algorithmic music field.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,4,25]]},"citation-key":"OxfordHandbookAlgorithmic2018","DOI":"10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190226992.001.0001","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,2,22]]},"language":"en","source":"www.oxfordhandbooks.com","title":"The Oxford Handbook of Algorithmic Music","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190226992.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780190226992"},

Animated films and television programs make up a substantial part of their experience of narratives and as such are an important resource in their talk and play. Making space in schools for this aspect of children's repertoires of narrative, even in the context of animated film production, can be challenging. In this article I explore some of the barriers to incorporating children's experiences of animation and then offer an account of an activity in which six fifth-year children were encouraged to draw on their popular culture experiences of animation in their text productions. These data demonstrate the way the children were able to create meaning using the affordances of all the modes of animation, revealing their implicit understandings of narrative conventions. The data raise questions regarding what constitutes good and acceptable storytelling in animated films in school and how to accommodate collaborative, hybrid, and transgressive texts and text production in the primary classroom. Finally, I examine the way in which the currency of popular culture affects the hierarchy of learners and the necessity of finding new ways to enable children to share their funds of knowledge about animation in the classroom.","author":[{"family":"Parry","given":"Becky"}],"citation-key":"parryCowboyMutantGolfers2011","container-title":"International Journal of Learning and Media","DOI":"10.1162/ijlm_a_00074","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,7]]},"page":"43–53","title":"Cowboy Mutant Golfers and Dreamcatcher Dogs: Making Space for Popular Culture in Animation Production with Children","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/ijlm_a_00074","volume":"3"},

What are the neural mechanisms of musical beat perception, and how did they evolve? One view, which dates back to Darwin and implicitly informs some current models of beat perception, is that the relevant neural mechanisms are relatively general and are widespread among animal species. On the basis of recent neural and cross-species data on musical beat processing, this paper argues for a different view. Here we argue that beat perception is a complex brain function involving temporally-precise communication between auditory regions and motor planning regions of the cortex (even in the absence of overt movement). More specifically, we propose that simulation of periodic movement in motor planning regions provides a neural signal that helps the auditory system predict the timing of upcoming beats. This \"action simulation for auditory prediction\" (ASAP) hypothesis leads to testable predictions. We further suggest that ASAP relies on dorsal auditory pathway connections between auditory regions and motor planning regions via the parietal cortex, and suggest that these connections may be stronger in humans than in non-human primates due to the evolution of vocal learning in our lineage. This suggestion motivates cross-species research to determine which species are capable of human-like beat perception, i.e., beat perception that involves accurate temporal prediction of beat times across a fairly broad range of tempi.","author":[{"family":"Patel","given":"Aniruddh D."},{"family":"Iversen","given":"John R."}],"citation-key":"patelEvolutionaryNeuroscienceMusical2014","container-title":"Frontiers in systems neuroscience","DOI":"10.3389/fnsys.2014.00057","ISSN":"1662-5137","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"PMCID":"PMC4026735","PMID":"24860439","title":"The evolutionary neuroscience of musical beat perception: the Action Simulation for Auditory Prediction (ASAP) hypothesis.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnsys.2014.00057","volume":"8"},

One approach to the empirical comparison of rhythm in language and music is to break rhythm down into subcomponents and compare each component across domains. This approach reveals empirical evidence that rhythmic grouping is an area of overlap between language and music, but no empirical support for the long-held notion that language has periodic structure comparable to that of music. Focusing on the statistical patterning of event duration, new evidence suggests that the linguistic rhythm of a culture leaves an imprint on its musical rhythm. The latter finding suggests that one effective strategy for comparing rhythm in language and music is to determine if differences in linguistic rhythm between cultures are reflected in differences in musical rhythm.","author":[{"family":"Patel","given":"Aniruddh D."}],"citation-key":"patelRhythmLanguageMusic2003","container-title":"Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1196/annals.1284.015","ISSN":"0077-8923","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,11]]},"page":"140–143","PMID":"14681127","title":"Rhythm in language and music: parallels and differences.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1196/annals.1284.015","volume":"999"},

There are two forms of size information in these source-filter sounds, information about the size of the excitation mechanism (the vocal folds), and information about the size of the resonators in the vocal tract that filter the excitation before it is projected into the air. The current definitions of pitch and timbre treat the two forms of size information differently.

  {"id":"petittoBabyHandsThat2004","abstract":"The \"ba, ba, ba\" sound universal to babies' babbling around 7 months captures scientific attention because it provides insights into the mechanisms underlying language acquisition and vestiges of its evolutionary origins. Yet the prevailing mystery is what is the biological basis of babbling, with one hypothesis being that it is a non-linguistic motoric activity driven largely by the baby's emerging control over the mouth and jaw, and another being that it is a linguistic activity reflecting the babies' early sensitivity to specific phonetic-syllabic patterns. Two groups of hearing babies were studied over time (ages 6, 10, and 12 months), equal in all developmental respects except for the modality of language input (mouth versus hand): three hearing babies acquiring spoken language (group 1: \"speech-exposed\") and a rare group of three hearing babies acquiring sign language only, not speech (group 2: \"sign-exposed\"). Despite this latter group's exposure to sign, the motoric hypothesis would predict similar hand activity to that seen in speech-exposed hearing babies because language acquisition in sign-exposed babies does not involve the mouth. Using innovative quantitative Optotrak 3-D motion-tracking technology, applied here for the first time to study infant language acquisition, we obtained physical measurements similar to a speech spectrogram, but for the hands. Here we discovered that the specific rhythmic frequencies of the hands of the sign-exposed hearing babies differed depending on whether they were producing linguistic activity, which they produced at a low frequency of approximately 1 Hz, versus non-linguistic activity, which they produced at a higher frequency of approximately 2.5 Hz - the identical class of hand activity that the speech-exposed hearing babies produced nearly exclusively. Surprisingly, without benefit of the mouth, hearing sign-exposed babies alone babbled systematically on their hands. We conclude that babbling is fundamentally a linguistic activity and explain why the differentiation between linguistic and non-linguistic hand activity in a single manual modality (one distinct from the human mouth) could only have resulted if all babies are born with a sensitivity to specific rhythmic patterns at the heart of human language and the capacity to use them.","author":[{"family":"Petitto","given":"L.

Science, 308, 1430) demonstrated an early cross-modal interaction between body movement and auditory encoding of musical rhythm in infants. Here we show that the way adults move their bodies to music influences their auditory perception of the rhythm structure. We trained adults, while listening to an ambiguous rhythm with no accented beats, to bounce by bending their knees to interpret the rhythm either as a march or as a waltz. At test, adults identified as similar an auditory version of the rhythm pattern with accented strong beats that matched their previous bouncing experience in comparison with a version whose accents did not match. In subsequent experiments we showed that this effect does not depend on visual information, but that movement of the body is critical. Parallel results from adults and infants suggest that the movement-sound interaction develops early and is fundamental to music processing throughout life.","author":[{"family":"Phillips-Silver","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Trainor","given":"Laurel J."}],"citation-key":"phillips-silverHearingWhatBody2007","container-title":"Cognition","DOI":"10.1016/j.cognition.2006.11.006","ISSN":"0010-0277","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,12]]},"page":"533–546","PMID":"17196580","title":"Hearing what the body feels: auditory encoding of rhythmic movement.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2006.11.006","volume":"105"},
  {"id":"PianoRoll2017","abstract":"A piano roll is a music storage medium used to operate a player piano, piano player or reproducing piano. A piano roll is a continuous roll of paper with perforations (holes) punched into it. The perforations represent note control data. The roll moves over a reading system known as a 'tracker bar' and the playing cycle for each musical note is triggered when a perforation crosses the bar and is read.\n\nThe majority of piano rolls play on three distinct musical scales. The 65-note (with a playing range of A1 to C♯7) format was introduced in 1896 in the USA specifically for piano music. In 1900 an American format playing all 88 notes (A0 to C8) of the standard piano scale was introduced. In 1902 a German 72-note scale (F1, G1 to E7) was introduced. All of these scales were subject to being operated by piano rolls of varying dimensions. The 1908 Buffalo Convention of US manufacturers standardized the US industry to the 88-note scale and fixed the physical dimensions for that scale.\nPiano rolls were in continuous mass production from around 1896 to 2008, and are still available today, with QRS Music claiming to have 45,000 titles available with \"new titles being added on a regular basis\". Largely replacing piano rolls, which are no longer mass-produced today, MIDI files represent a modern way in which musical performance data can be stored. MIDI files accomplish digitally and electronically what piano rolls do mechanically. Software for editing a performance stored as MIDI data often has a feature to show the music in a piano roll representation.\nThe first paper rolls were used commercially by Welte & Sons in their Orchestrions beginning in 1883.\nA rollography is a listing of piano rolls, especially made by a single performer, analogous to a discography.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,4,12]]},"citation-key":"PianoRoll2017","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,3,6]]},"language":"en","note":"Page Version ID: 768942539","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Piano roll","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Piano_roll&oldid=768942539"},

  {"id":"pylyshynThingsPlacesHow2007","abstract":"In <i>Things and Places,</i> Zenon Pylyshyn argues that the process of incrementally constructing perceptual representations, solving the binding problem (determining which properties go together), and, more generally, grounding perceptual representations in experience arise from the nonconceptual capacity to pick out and keep track of a small number of sensory individuals. He proposes a mechanism in early vision that allows us to select a limited number of sensory objects, to reidentify each of them under certain conditions as the same individual seen before, and to keep track of their enduring individuality despite radical changes in their properties–all without the machinery of concepts, identity, and tenses. This mechanism, which he calls FINSTs (for \"Fingers of Instantiation\"), is responsible for our capacity to individuate and track several independently moving sensory objects–an ability that we exercise every waking minute, and one that can be understood as fundamental to the way we see and understand the world and to our sense of space.<br /> <br /> Pylyshyn examines certain empirical phenomena of early vision in light of the FINST mechanism, including tracking and attentional selection. He argues provocatively that the initial selection of perceptual individuals is our primary nonconceptual contact with the perceptual world (a contact that does not depend on prior encoding of any properties of the thing selected) and then draws on a wide range of empirical data to support a radical externalist theory of spatial representation that grows out of his indexing theory.","author":[{"family":"Pylyshyn","given":"Zenon W."}],"citation-key":"pylyshynThingsPlacesHow2007","edition":"First","ISBN":"0-262-16245-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,10]]},"note":"Published: Hardcover","publisher":"The MIT Press","title":"Things and Places: How the Mind Connects with the World (Jean Nicod Lectures)","type":"book","URL":"http://www.worldcat.org/isbn/0262162458"},
  {"id":"radcliffeRevolutionChallengingAutomaton2012","abstract":"This chapter examines a performance devised and developed collaboratively by the authors between 2007 -11 which uses a repetitious, machine-inspired nineteenth-century dance to control a digital arts piece, exploring the performative interface between human machine workers and technology. The performance was awarded a Quake contemporary dance festival award in 2008. The dance, the The Machinery, traceable to the1820s, is striking as possibly the earliest example of the creative expression of alienation and dehumanization in the industrial workspace. Nineteenth-century cotton mill workers surrendered to the pace of the machine through necessity; in The Machinery, workers find a means of expression by coalescing with the machine, rather than escaping it, reflecting De Certeau's theories of ?the everyday?. A means of addressing boredom and repetition, the predominantly female workers responded performatively to the otherwise potentially overpowering and isolating noises and actions of ?the uniform and unceasing motion of the automaton? (Marx). The dance can be viewed as a way of maintaining the body's control, interaction and creativity, rather than allowing the body to become solely an extension of the capitalist means of production. Paralleling the working conditions of the nineteenth-century textile workers with those of today's computer operators, Radcliffe and Angliss created a mixed media performance piece inspired by women's interaction with technology. Taking the steps of the early nineteenth-century clog dance, they re-contextualised its history, using it to control a machine of the twenty-first century, the digital computer. Thus, the performers - dancer and computer operator - work together to create an intermedial space where the real world, occupied by the human worker, and virtual world of the machine are coupled to each other and acting in equal partnership. The extreme, machine-like control, virtuosity and physical endurance of the dance reflect the stamina required to survive repetitive labour in both the industrial and the post-industrial workplace.","author":[{"family":"Radcliffe","given":"Caroline"},{"family":"Angliss","given":"Sarah"}],"citation-key":"radcliffeRevolutionChallengingAutomaton2012","container-title":"Performance Research","DOI":"10.1080/13528165.2013.775758","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,12]]},"page":"40–47","title":"Revolution: Challenging the automaton: Repetitive labour and dance in the industrial workspace","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13528165.2013.775758","volume":"17"},

  {"id":"ramachandranPsychophysicalInvestigationsNeural2001","abstract":"We studied two otherwise normal, synaesthetic subjects who 'saw' a specific colour every time they saw a specific number or letter. We conducted four experiments in order to show that this was a genuine perceptual experience rather than merely a memory association. (i) The synaesthetically induced colours could lead to perceptual grouping, even though the inducing numerals or letters did not. (ii) Synaesthetically induced colours were not experienced if the graphemes were presented peripherally. (iii) Roman numerals were ineffective: the actual number grapheme was required. (iv) If two graphemes were alternated the induced colours were also seen in alternation. However, colours were no longer experienced if the graphemes were alternated at more than 4 Hz. We propose that grapheme colour synaesthesia arises from 'cross-wiring' between the 'colour centre' (area V4 or V8) and the 'number area', both of which lie in the fusiform gyrus. We also suggest a similar explanation for the representation of metaphors in the brain: hence, the higher incidence of synaesthesia among artists and poets.","author":[{"family":"Ramachandran","given":"V.

  {"id":"ramachandranSynaesthesiaWindowPerception2001","abstract":"We investigated grapheme-colour synaesthesia and found that (1) The induced colours led to perceptual grouping and pop-out, (2) a number rendered invisible through &#039;crowding&#039; or lateral masking can induce synaesthetic colours – a form of blindsight – and (3) peripherally presented graphemes did not induce colours even when they were clearly visible. Taken collectively, these and other experiments prove conclusively that synaesthesia is a genuine perceptual phenomenon, not an effect based on memory associations from childhood or on vague metaphorical speech. We identify different subtypes of number-colour synaesthesia and propose that they are caused by hyperconnectivity between colour and number areas at different stages in processing; lower synaesthetes may have cross-wiring (or cross-activation) within the fusiform gyrus whereas higher synaesthetes may have cross-activation in the angular gyrus. This hyperconnectivity might be caused by a genetic mutation that causes defective pruning of connections between brain maps. The mutation may further be expressed selectively (due to transcription factors) in the fusiform or angular gyri, and this may explain the existence of different forms of synaesthesia. If expressed very diffusely, there may be extensive cross-wiring between brain regions that represent abstract concepts, which would explain the link between creativity, metaphor and synaesthesia (and the higher incidence of synaesthesia among artists and poets). Also, hyperconnectivity between the sensory cortex and amygdala would explain the heightened aversion synaesthetes experience when seeing numbers printed in the &#039;wrong&#039; colour. Lastly, kindling – induced hyperconnectivity in the temporal lobes of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients – may explain the purported higher incidence of synaesthesia in these patients. We conclude with a synaesthesia-based theory of the evolution of language. Thus, our experiments on synaesthesia and our theoretical framework attempt to link several seemingly unrelated facts about the human mind. Far from being a mere curiosity, synaesthesia may provide a window into perception, thought and language.","author":[{"family":"Ramachandran","given":"V. S."},{"family":"Hubbard","given":"E.

  {"id":"raubalRepresentingConceptsTime2008","abstract":"People make use of concepts in all aspects of their lives. Concepts are mental entities, which structure our experiences and support reasoning in the world. They are usually regarded as static, although there is ample evidence that they change over time with respect to structure, content, and relation to real-world objects and processes. Recent research considers concepts as dynamical systems, emphasizing this potential for change. In order to analyze the alteration of concepts in time, a formal representation of this process is necessary. This paper proposes an algebraic model for representing dynamic conceptual structures, which integrates two theories from geography and cognitive science, i.e., time geography and conceptual spaces. Such representation allows for investigating the development of a conceptual structure along space-time paths and serves as a foundation for querying the structure of concepts at a specific point in time or for a time interval. The geospatial concept of 'landmark' is used to demonstrate the formal specifications.","author":[{"family":"Raubal","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"raubalRepresentingConceptsTime2008","container-title":"Proceedings of the international conference on Spatial Cognition VI","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-540-87601-4_24","event-place":"Freiburg, Germany","ISBN":"978-3-540-87600-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008]]},"page":"328–343","publisher":"Springer-Verlag","publisher-place":"Freiburg, Germany","title":"Representing Concepts in Time","type":"chapter","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-87601-4_24"},

In a dual-task method, listeners attended concurrently to both aspects, component and pattern, of a sine wave analogue of a word. Organization of elements was indexed by several single-mode tests of auditory form perception to verify the perceptual segregation of either an individual formant of a synthetic word or a tonal component of a sinusoidal word analogue. Organization of patterned variation was indexed by a test of lexical identification. The results show the independence of the perception of auditory and phonetic form, which appear to be differently organized concurrent effects of the same acoustic cause.","author":[{"family":"Remez","given":"Robert E."},{"family":"Pardo","given":"Jennifer S."},{"family":"Piorkowski","given":"Rebecca L."},{"family":"Rubin","given":"Philip E."}],"citation-key":"remezBistabilitySineWave2001","container-title":"Psychological Science","DOI":"10.1111/1467-9280.00305","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2001]]},"page":"24–29","title":"On the Bistability of Sine Wave Analogues of Speech","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-9280.00305","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"reznikoffSoundResonancePrehistoric2008","abstract":"Caves have natural properties of resonance: some parts sound very well, the sound lasts for some seconds or gives several echoes, some other parts have a dull resonance or no resonance at all. It is extremely interesting to compare in a given cave the map of the most resonant locations with the map of the locations of the paintings: are there correlations between resonance and paintings? We have studied many Paleolithic caves in France in which the answer was remarkably positive; stated shortly: the more resonant the location, the more paintings or signs are situated in this location. Here are presented some studies and results in the caves of Isturitz and Oxocelhaya in Pays Basque and in some other caves. Some considerations are given about the resonance ‐ pictures relationship in open spaces with prehistoric painted rocks. Bibliography I.

  {"id":"rizzolattiMirrorNeuronSystem2004","abstract":"A category of stimuli of great importance for primates, humans in particular, is that formed by actions done by other individuals. If we want to survive, we must understand the actions of others. Furthermore, without action understanding, social organization is impossible. In the case of humans, there is another faculty that depends on the observation of others' actions: imitation learning. Unlike most species, we are able to learn by imitation, and this faculty is at the basis of human culture. In this review we present data on a neurophysiological mechanism–the mirror-neuron mechanism–that appears to play a fundamental role in both action understanding and imitation. We describe first the functional properties of mirror neurons in monkeys. We review next the characteristics of the mirror-neuron system in humans. We stress, in particular, those properties specific to the human mirror-neuron system that might explain the human capacity to learn by imitation. We conclude by discussing the relationship between the mirror-neuron system and language.","author":[{"family":"Rizzolatti","given":"Giacomo"},{"family":"Craighero","given":"Laila"}],"citation-key":"rizzolattiMirrorNeuronSystem2004","container-title":"Annual review of neuroscience","DOI":"10.1146/annurev.neuro.27.070203.144230","ISSN":"0147-006X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004]]},"page":"169–192","PMID":"15217330","title":"The Mirror-Neuron System","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.neuro.27.070203.144230","volume":"27"},

To test the salience of these images, the authors conducted experiments to determine whether the images could visually influence the perception of discrepant auditory syllables. Results showed that these images can influence auditory speech independently of the participant's knowledge of the stimuli. In other experiments, single frozen frames of visible syllables were presented with discrepant auditory syllables to test the salience of static facial features. Although the influence of the kinematic stimuli was perceptual, any influence of the static featural stimuli was likely based on participant's misunderstanding or postperceptual response bias.","author":[{"family":"Rosenblum","given":"L.

Why these specific intervals in music are preferred, however, is not known. In the present study, we analyzed a database of individually spoken English vowel phones to examine the hypothesis that musical intervals arise from the relationships of the formants in speech spectra that determine the perceptions of distinct vowels. Expressed as ratios, the frequency relationships of the first two formants in vowel phones represent all 12 intervals of the chromatic scale. Were the formants to fall outside the ranges found in the human voice, their relationships would generate either a less complete or a more dilute representation of these specific intervals. These results imply that human preference for the intervals of the chromatic scale arises from experience with the way speech formants modulate laryngeal harmonics to create different phonemes.","author":[{"family":"Ross","given":"Deborah"},{"family":"Choi","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Purves","given":"Dale"}],"citation-key":"rossMusicalIntervalsSpeech2007","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.0703140104","ISSN":"0027-8424","issue":"23","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,6]]},"page":"9852–9857","PMCID":"PMC1876656","PMID":"17525146","title":"Musical intervals in speech.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0703140104","volume":"104"},

  {"id":"sawyerExplainingCreativityScience2006","abstract":"Explaining Creativity is an accessible introduction to the latest scientific research on creativity. In the last 50 yearss, psychologists, anthropologists, and sociologists have increasingly studied creativity, and we now know more about creativity that at any point in history. Explaining Creativity considers not only arts like painting and writing, but also science, stage performance, and business innovation. Until about a decade ago, creativity researchers tended to focus on highly valued activities like fine art painting and Nobel prize winning science. Sawyer brings this research up to date by including movies, music videos, cartoons, videogames, hypertext fiction, and computer technology. For example, this is the first book on creativity to include studies of performance and improvisation. Sawyer draws on the latest research findings to show the importance of collaboration and context in all of these creative activities. Today's science of creativity is interdisciplinary; in addition to psychological studies of creativity, Explaining Creativity includes research by anthropologists on creativity in non-Western cultures, and research by sociologists about the situations, contexts, and networks of creative activity. Explaining Creativity brings these approaches together within the sociocultural approach to creativity pioneered by Howard Becker, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and Howard Gardner. The sociocultural approach moves beyond the individual to consider the social and cultural contexts of creativity, emphasizing the role of collaboration and context in the creative process.","author":[{"family":"Sawyer","given":"Keith R."}],"citation-key":"sawyerExplainingCreativityScience2006","ISBN":"0-19-530445-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,1]]},"note":"Published: Paperback","publisher":"Oxford University Press, USA","title":"Explaining Creativity: The Science of Human Innovation","type":"book","URL":"http://www.worldcat.org/isbn/0195304454"},

  {"id":"senghasChildrenCreatingLanguage2001","abstract":"It has long been postulated that language is not purely learned, but arises from an interaction between environmental exposure and innate abilities. The innate component becomes more evident in rare situations in which the environment is markedly impoverished. The present study investigated the language production of a generation of deaf Nicaraguans who had not been exposed to a developed language. We examined the changing use of early linguistic structures (specifically, spatial modulations) in a sign language that has emerged since the Nicaraguan group first came together. In under two decades, sequential cohorts of learners systematized the grammar of this new sign language. We examined whether the systematicity being added to the language stems from children or adults; our results indicate that such changes originate in children aged 10 and younger. Thus, sequential cohorts of interacting young children collectively possess the capacity not only to learn, but also to create, language.","author":[{"family":"Senghas","given":"A."},{"family":"Coppola","given":"M."}],"citation-key":"senghasChildrenCreatingLanguage2001","container-title":"Psychological Science","DOI":"10.1111/1467-9280.00359","ISSN":"1467-9280","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2001,7]]},"page":"323–328","PMID":"11476100","title":"Children Creating Language: How Nicaraguan Sign Language Acquired a Spatial Grammar","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-9280.00359","volume":"12"},

Nevertheless, in most western countries, girls show a lack of interest in computer science, including programming. This paper presents the results of two user studies with 24 female German secondary school students in two programming workshops. We use and compare two environments based on Scratch and Google Blockly in fostering the students' programming skills and changing their attitudes towards programming. The two block-based programming editors have been chosen as they are popular in the current educational use of block-based programming. The results support the usage of Scratch-based environment in order to support the acquisition of programming skills. However, those students who used the Blockly-based environment showed greater interest in future programming learning opportunities. The contribution of this paper is showing the different impacts of Scratch and Google Blockly on young female students' interest in programming and the acquisition of programming skills in extra-curricular programming workshops.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Seraj","given":"Mazyar"},{"family":"Katterfeldt","given":"Eva-Sophie"},{"family":"Bub","given":"Kerstin"},{"family":"Autexier","given":"Serge"},{"family":"Drechsler","given":"Rolf"}],"citation-key":"serajScratchGoogleBlockly2019","collection-title":"Koli Calling '19","container-title":"Proceedings of the 19th Koli Calling International Conference on Computing Education Research","DOI":"10.1145/3364510.3364515","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-7715-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,21]]},"page":"1–10","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Scratch and Google Blockly: How Girls' Programming Skills and Attitudes are Influenced","title-short":"Scratch and Google Blockly","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3364510.3364515"},

This arbitrary relation is often assumed to also characterize the mental representations underlying language comprehension. We explore the idea that visuo-spatial information can be analogically conveyed through acoustic properties of speech and that such information is integrated into an analog perceptual representation as a natural part of comprehension. Listeners heard sentences describing objects, spoken at varying speaking rates. After each sentence, participants saw a picture of an object and judged whether it had been mentioned in the sentence. Participants were faster to recognize the object when motion implied by speaking rate matched the motion implied by the picture.

Studying members of such developer profile aggregators, we found an ecosystem that revolves around the social programmer. Developers are assessing each other to evaluate whether other developers are interesting, worth following, or worth collaborating with. They are self-conscious about being assessed, and thus manage their public images. They value passion for software development, new technologies, and learning. Some recruiters participate in the ecosystem and use it to find candidates for hiring; other recruiters struggle with the interpretation of signals and issues of trust.

A novel approach to apply time series segmentation to discern temporal information from software version repositories is proposed. Data from such repositories, both numeric and non-numeric, are represented as item-set time series data. A dynamic programming algorithm for optimal segmentation is presented. The algorithm automatically produces a compacted item-set time series that can be analyzed to identify temporal patterns. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated by analyzing version control repositories of several open-source projects to identify time-varying patterns of developer activity. The experimental results show that the segmentation algorithm produces segments that capture meaningful information and is superior to the information content obtained by arbitrarily segmenting software history into regular time intervals.

Electroacoustic music experience, particularly acousmatic music, questions the viability of a notion of timbre. Of primary significance is the traditional linking of timbre to the source and cause of a sound: the concept of source-cause texture is introduced to define this link. The ambiguous relationship between pitch and timbre indicates that timbre cannot be defined as that part of the sound which is not pitch. Problems in establishing the existence of sonic identities within the musical context, and of maintaining the coherence of identities are discussed, opening up questions relating to musical discourse. Two types of discourse transformational and typological are defined, leading to the notion of generic timbre. In a spectromorphological music where defining identities becomes problematic it becomes impossible to disentangle timbre from discourse: here the notion of timbre has a limited viability.","author":[{"family":"Smalley","given":"Denis"}],"citation-key":"smalleyDefiningTimbreRefining1994","container-title":"Contemporary Music Review","DOI":"10.1080/07494469400640281","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1994]]},"page":"35–48","title":"Defining timbre Refining timbre","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07494469400640281","volume":"10"},

The language semantics, user interface, and implementation each help create this integrated experience. The language semantics embed the programmer in a uniform world of simple objects that can be modified without appealing to definitions of abstractions. In a similar way, the graphical interface puts the user into a uniform world of tangible objects that can be direcdy manipulated and changed without switching modes. The implementation strives to support the world-of-objects illusion by minimizing perceptible pauses and by providing true source-level semantics without sacrificing performance. As a side benefit, it encourages factoring.

  {"id":"spencerSpeedAnalysesStimulus1996","abstract":"The functional substitutability of stimuli in equivalence classes was examined through analyses of the speed of college students' accurate responding. After training subjects to respond to 18 conditional relations, subjects' accuracy and speed of accurate responding were compared across trial types (baseline, symmetry, transitivity, and combined transitivity and symmetry) and nodal distance (one- through five-node transitive and combined transitive and symmetric relations). Differences in accuracy across nodal distance and trial type were significant only on the first tests of equivalence, whereas differences in speed were significant even after extended testing. Response speed was inversely related to the number of nodes on which the tested relations were based. Significant differences in response speed were also found across trial types, except between transitivity and combined trials. To determine the generality of these comparisons, three groups of subjects were included: An instructed group was given an instruction that specified the interchangeability of stimuli related through training; a queried group was queried about the basis for test-trial responding: and a standard group was neither instructed nor queried. There were no significant differences among groups. These results suggest the use of response speed and response accuracy to measure the strength of matching relations.","author":[{"family":"Spencer","given":"T. J."},{"family":"Chase","given":"P.

Several laboratories have been unable to confirm the existence of the effect despite two positive reports from the original laboratory. The authors of the original studies have provided a list of key procedural components to produce the effect. This experiment attempted to produce a Mozart effect by following those procedural instructions and replicating the procedure of one of the original positive reports. The experiment failed to produce either a statistically significant Mozart effect or an effect size suggesting practical significance. This general lack of effect is consistent with previous work by other investigators.

Even though it has been shown that specifically chosen musical pieces can prime meaningful concepts, the empirical evidence in favor of such a highly specific semantic pathway has been lacking. Here we show that 2 event-related potentials in response to harmonic expectancy violations, the early right anterior negativity (ERAN) and the N500, could be systematically modulated by simultaneously presented language material containing either a syntactic or a semantic violation. Whereas the ERAN was reduced only when presented concurrently with a syntactic language violation and not with a semantic language violation, this pattern was reversed for the N500. This is the first piece of evidence showing that tension- resolution patterns represent a route to meaning in music.","author":[{"family":"Steinbeis","given":"Nikolaus"},{"family":"Koelsch","given":"Stefan"}],"citation-key":"steinbeisSharedNeuralResources2008","container-title":"Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)","DOI":"10.1093/cercor/bhm149","ISSN":"1460-2199","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,5]]},"page":"1169–1178","PMID":"17720685","title":"Shared neural resources between music and language indicate semantic processing of musical tension-resolution patterns.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhm149","volume":"18"},

We argue that a cognitive theory of peoples' reasoning performance must account for (a) the logical equivalence of inferences expressed in graphical and linguistic form, and (b) the implementational differences that affect facility of inference. Our theory proposes that graphical representation limit abstraction and thereby aid ” processibility”. We discuss the ideas of specificity and abstraction, and their cognitive relevance. Empirical support both comes from tasks which involve the manipulation of external graphics and tasks that do not. For the former, we take Euler's (1772) circles, provide a novel computational reconstruction, show how it captures abstractions, and contrast it with earlier construals and with Johnson-Laird's (1983) mental models representations. We demonstrate equivalence of the graphical Euler system, and the nongraphical mental models system. For tasks not involving manipulation of external graphics, we discuss text comprehension, and the mental performance of syllogisms. By positing an internal system with the same specificity as Euler's circles, we cover the mental models data, and generate new empirical predictions. Finally, we consider how the architecture of working memory explains why such specific representations are relatively easy to store.","author":[{"family":"Stenning","given":"Keith"},{"family":"Oberlander","given":"Jon"}],"citation-key":"stenningCognitiveTheoryGraphical1995","container-title":"Cognitive Science","DOI":"10.1207/s15516709cog1901_3","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1995,1]]},"page":"97–140","title":"A Cognitive Theory of Graphical and Linguistic Reasoning: Logic and Implementation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15516709cog1901_3","volume":"19"},

  {"id":"TalaMusic2016","abstract":"A Tala (IAST tāla), sometimes spelled Taala, Taal or Tal, literally means a \"clap, tapping one's hand on one's arm, a musical measure\". It is the term used in Indian classical music to refer to musical meter, that is any rhythmic beat or strike that measures musical time. The measure is typically established by hand clapping, waving, touching fingers on thigh or the other hand, verbally, striking of small cymbals, or a percussion instrument in the South Asian traditions. Along with raga which forms the fabric of a melodic structure, the tala forms the time cycle and thereby constitutes one of the two foundational elements of Indian music.\nTala is an ancient music concept traceable to Vedic era texts of Hinduism, such as the Samaveda and methods for singing the Vedic hymns. The music traditions of the North and South India, particularly the raga and tala systems, were not considered as distinct till about the 16th century. There on, during the turmoils of Islamic rule period of the Indian subcontinent, the traditions separated and evolved into distinct forms. The tala system of the north is called Hindustani, while the south is called Carnatic. However, the tala system between them continues to have more common features than differences.\nTala in the Indian tradition embraces the time dimension of music, the means by which musical rhythm and form were guided and expressed. While a tala carries the musical meter, it does not necessarily imply a regularly recurring pattern. In the major classical Indian music traditions, the beats are hierarchically arranged based on how the music piece is to performed. The most widely used tala in the South Indian system is adi tala.

  {"id":"tanimotoVIVAVisualLanguage1990","abstract":"Visual languages have been developed to help new programmers express algorithms easily. They also help to make experienced programmers more productive by simplifying the organization of a program through the use of visual representations. However, visual languages have not reached their full potential because of several problems including the following: difficulty of producing visual representations for the more abstract computing constructs; the lack of adequate computing power to update the visual representations in response to user actions; the immaturity of the subfield of visual programming and need for additional breakthroughs and standardization of existing mechanisms. Visualization of Vision Algorithms (VIVA) is a proposed visual language for image processing. Its main purpose is to serve as an effective teaching tool for students of image processing. Its design also takes account of several secondary goals, including the completion of a software platform for research in human/image interaction, the creation of a vehicle for studying algorithms and architectures for parallel image processing, and the establishment of a presentation medium for image-processing algorithms.","author":[{"family":"Tanimoto","given":"Steven L."}],"citation-key":"tanimotoVIVAVisualLanguage1990","container-title":"J.

  {"id":"tedreLongQuestComputational2016","abstract":"Computational thinking (CT) is a popular phrase that refers to a collection of computational ideas and habits of mind that people in computing disciplines acquire through their work in designing programs, software, simulations, and computations performed by machinery. Recently a computational thinking for K-12 movement has spawned initiatives across the education sector, and educational reforms are under way in many countries. However, modern CT initiatives should be well aware of the broad and deep history of computational thinking, or risk repeating already refuted claims, past mistakes, and already solved problems, or losing some of the richest and most ambitious ideas in CT. This paper presents an overview of three important historical currents from which CT has developed: evolution of computing's disciplinary ways of thinking and practicing, educational research and efforts in computing, and emergence of computational science and digitalization of society. The paper examines a number of threats to CT initiatives: lack of ambition, dogmatism, knowing versus doing, exaggerated claims, narrow views of computing, overemphasis on formulation, and lost sight of computational models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Tedre","given":"Matti"},{"family":"Denning","given":"Peter J."}],"citation-key":"tedreLongQuestComputational2016","collection-title":"Koli Calling '16","container-title":"Proceedings of the 16th Koli Calling International Conference on Computing Education Research","DOI":"10.1145/2999541.2999542","event-place":"Koli, Finland","ISBN":"978-1-4503-4770-9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,11,24]]},"page":"120–129","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"Koli, Finland","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"The long quest for computational thinking","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2999541.2999542"},

We show that the ID speech style reflects free vocal expression of emotion to infants, in comparison with more inhibited expression of emotion in typical AD speech. When AD speech does express emotion, the same acoustic features are used as in ID speech. We recorded ID and AD samples of speech expressing love-comfort, fear, and surprise. The emotions were equally discriminable in the ID and AD samples. Acoustic analyses showed few differences between the ID and AD samples, but robust differences across the emotions.

When guitarists talk about a guitar sound as being round, it would mean that it sounds like a round-shaped-mouth sound, such as the vowel /O/. Although the acoustic systems of the guitar and of the voice mechanism are structurally different, we highlight the fact that guitar tones and a particular set of vowels display similar formant regions.

The proposed approach involves two key ideas. Firstly, a feature-selection algorithm is used to identify those acoustic features that optimally model each class of transient sound. Secondly, features that are perceptually motivated are proposed, i.e., they encode information that human listeners are likely to use in transient classification tasks. Three perceptual features are proposed, which encode timbre, the physical material of the sound source, and the temporal context (pattern) in which the transient occurred. The authors show how these features, which are computed over different temporal windows, can be combined to make classification decisions. The performance of the proposed classifier is evaluated on a corpus of transient signals extracted from passive sonar recordings. Specifically, the performance of the perceptual features is compared with spectral features and with those that encode statistics of time, frequency, and power. The present results show that the perceptual features provide valuable cues to the class of a transient. However, the best performing classifier was obtained by selecting a subset of perceptual, spectral, and statistical features in a class-dependent manner.","author":[{"family":"Tucker","given":"S."},{"family":"Brown","given":"G.

Her interviews reveal that we experience computers as being on the border between inanimate and animate, as both an extension of the self and part of the external world. Their special place betwixt and between traditional categories is part of what makes them compelling and evocative.

A new set-theoretical approach to similarity is developed in which objects are represented as collections of features and similarity is described as a feature-matching process. Specifically, a set of qualitative assumptions is shown to imply the contrast model, which expresses the similarity between objects as a linear combination of the measures of their common and distinctive features. Several predictions of the contrast model are tested in studies of similarity with both semantic and perceptual stimuli. The model is used to uncover, analyze, and explain a variety of empirical phenomena such as the role of common and distinctive features, the relations between judgments of similarity and difference, the presence of asymmetric similarities, and the effects of context on judgments of similarity. The contrast model generalizes standard representations of similarity data in terms of clusters and trees.

As such, they offer direct insight into the worldview of the Inka―a view that differs from European thought as much as khipus differ from alphabetic writing, which the Inka did not possess. Scholars have spent decades attempting to decipher the Inka khipus, and Gary Urton has become the world's leading authority on these artifacts.In Inka History in Knots, Urton marshals a lifetime of study to offer a grand overview of the types of quantative information recorded in khipus and to show how these records can be used as primary sources for an Inka history of the empire that focuses on statistics, demography, and the \"longue durée\" social processes that characterize a civilization continuously adapting to and exploiting its environment. Whether the Inka khipu keepers were registering census data, recording tribute, or performing many other administrative tasks, Urton asserts that they were key players in the organization and control of subject populations throughout the empire and that khipu record-keeping vitally contributed to the emergence of political complexity in the Andes.

  {"id":"victorHumaneRepresentationThought2014","abstract":"New representations of thought – written language, mathematical notation, information graphics, etc – have been responsible for some of the most significant leaps in the progress of civilization, by expanding humanity's collectively-thinkable territory. But at debilitating cost. These representations, having been invented for static media such as paper, tap into a small subset of human capabilities and neglect the rest. Knowledge work means sitting at a desk, interpreting and manipulating symbols. The human body is reduced to an eye staring at tiny rectangles and fingers on a pen or keyboard. Like any severely unbalanced way of living, this is crippling to mind and body. But less obviously, and more importantly, it is enormously wasteful of the vast human potential. Human beings naturally have many powerful modes of thinking and understanding. Most are incompatible with static media. In a culture that has contorted itself around the limitations of marks on paper, these modes are undeveloped, unrecognized, or scorned. We are now seeing the start of a dynamic medium. To a large extent, people today are using this medium merely to emulate and extend static representations from the era of paper, and to further constrain the ways in which the human body can interact with external representations of thought. But the dynamic medium offers the opportunity to deliberately invent a humane and empowering form of knowledge work. We can design dynamic representations which draw on the entire range of human capabilities – all senses, all forms of movement, all forms of understanding – instead of straining a few and atrophying the rest. This talk suggests how each of the human activities in which thought is externalized (conversing, presenting, reading, writing, etc) can be redesigned around such representations.","author":[{"family":"Victor","given":"Bret"}],"citation-key":"victorHumaneRepresentationThought2014","collection-title":"SPLASH '14","container-title":"Proceedings of the Companion Publication of the 2014 ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Systems, Programming, and Applications: Software for Humanity","DOI":"10.1145/2660252.2661746","event-place":"Portland, Oregon, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-3208-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"page":"5","publisher":"ACM","publisher-place":"Portland, Oregon, USA","title":"Humane Representation of Thought: A Trail Map for the 21st Century","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2660252.2661746"},

In an attempt to resolve this dispute, we conducted a meta-analysis to decipher which hemisphere truly dominates and under what circumstances. It was found that across people and situations, the right hemisphere is the more dominant for spatial processing. However, consideration of specific moderator variables yielded a more complex picture. For example, females showed no hemisphere preference while males showed a right hemisphere advantage. Also, no hemisphere preference was indicated for spatial visualization tasks while subjects performing spatial orientation and manual manipulation tasks displayed a predictable right hemisphere preference.

  {"id":"vul1VoodooCorrelationsSocial2008","abstract":"The newly emerging field of Social Neuroscience has drawn much attention in recent years, with high-profile studies frequently reporting extremely high (e.g., >.8) correlations between behavioral and self-report measures of personality or emotion and measures of brain activation obtained using fMRI. We show that these correlations often exceed what is statistically possible assuming the (evidently rather limited) reliability of both fMRI and personality/emotion measures. The implausibly high correlations are all the more puzzling because social-neuroscience method sections rarely contain sufficient detail to ascertain how these correlations were obtained. We surveyed authors of 54 articles that reported findings of this kind to determine the details of their analyses. More than half acknowledged using a strategy that computes separate correlations for individual voxels, and reports means of just the subset of voxels exceeding chosen thresholds. We show how this non-independent analysis grossly inflates correlations, while yielding reassuring-looking scattergrams. This analysis technique was used to obtain the vast majority of the implausibly high correlations in our survey sample. In addition, we argue that other analysis problems likely created entirely spurious correlations in some cases. We outline how the data from these studies could be reanalyzed with unbiased methods to provide the field with accurate estimates of the correlations in question. We urge authors to perform such reanalyses and to correct the scientific record.","author":[{"family":"Vul1","given":"Edward"},{"family":"Harris","given":"Christine"},{"family":"Winkielman","given":"Piotr"},{"family":"Pashler","given":"Harold"}],"citation-key":"vul1VoodooCorrelationsSocial2008","container-title":"Perspectives on Psychological Science","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008]]},"title":"Voodoo Correlations in Social Neuroscience","type":"article-journal"},

That is, the tools should support cognition. This key benefit is difficult to directly observe and measure, so evaluating such tools has been problematic. This paper describes an investigation into the application of distributed cognition theories to analyzing and observing cognitive support. Theories of cognitive support are used to generate an analysis of potential cognitive benefits provided by the compilation-error tracking facilities of a commercial software development environment. This analysis is used to generate a scheme for coding user observations such that cognitive support related activity can be tracked. Experiences in applying the technique on data from a field study are reported. The study also serves to provide a glimpse into the ways that programmers and tools cooperate.

To do this they need to acquire a threshold level of intellectual capital so that they are considered sufficiently competent to gain employment. This can therefore provide the industry with a solid foundation of the necessary support staff, capable of providing services to the local community supporting such educational initiatives. This initiative can then release the more conventionally educated to work at the cutting edge of industry. As a driver for wealth generation in India, the IT industry is remarkable. It demands a wide spectrum of intellectual capital. As diffusion of IT technology is predicted to pervade throughout the subcontinent, the demand for all levels of competence would seem to be buoyant. The training environment covered in this case study complements the traditional educational system and could furnish alternative career opportunities to certain sections of the community.\\ensuremath<p\\ensuremath>\\ensuremath</p\\ensuremath> This paper takes a strategic view throughout.

Central to symmetry analysis is the use of symmetry in the more precise sense of its geometrical isometries in contrast to its everyday meaning of balance. For this volume, Donald Crowe and Dorothy Washburn invited colleagues from several disciplines to apply the method of symmetry analysis to actual case studies from cultures around the world. The essays compiled here explore how cultural information is embedded in the symmetrical structure of pattern. From descriptions of patterns on objects as diverse as Nasca embroideries, Ica Valley ceramics, Quechua textiles, Yombe mats, and Zulu beadwork, as well as from Amazonian shamanic therapy, ceramic design among the Shipibo, and Turkish Yörük weaving, the contributors reveal how the symmetrical structures in the patterns describe aspects of each culture's fundamental principles for living in the world. This approach offers a profoundly fresh way to read the meaning in pattern by arguing that pattern communicates through the structural metaphors embedded in the symmetrical relationship of the pattern parts. The two volumes together offer readers a revolutionary new window into the communicative importance of design.","author":[{"family":"Washburn","given":"Washburn","suffix":"Dorothy Koster"},{"family":"Washburn","given":"Dorothy Koster"},{"family":"Crowe","given":"Donald W."},{"family":"Crowe","given":"Donald Warren"}],"citation-key":"washburnSymmetryComesAge2004","ISBN":"978-0-295-98366-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"396","publisher":"University of Washington Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Symmetry Comes of Age: The Role of Pattern in Culture","title-short":"Symmetry Comes of Age","type":"book"},

  {"id":"winklerModelingAuditoryScene2009","abstract":"Predictive processing of information is essential for goal-directed behavior. We offer an account of auditory perception suggesting that representations of predictable patterns, or 'regularities', extracted from the incoming sounds serve as auditory perceptual objects. The auditory system continuously searches for regularities within the acoustic signal. Primitive regularities may be encoded by neurons adapting their response to specific sounds. Such neurons have been observed in many parts of the auditory system. Representations of the detected regularities produce predictions of upcoming sounds as well as alternative solutions for parsing the composite input into coherent sequences potentially emitted by putative sound sources. Accuracy of the predictions can be utilized for selecting the most likely interpretation of the auditory input. Thus in our view, perception generates hypotheses about the causal structure of the world.","author":[{"family":"Winkler","given":"István"},{"family":"Denham","given":"Susan L."},{"family":"Nelken","given":"Israel"}],"citation-key":"winklerModelingAuditoryScene2009","container-title":"Trends in cognitive sciences","DOI":"10.1016/j.tics.2009.09.003","ISSN":"1879-307X","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,12]]},"page":"532–540","PMID":"19828357","title":"Modeling the auditory scene: predictive regularity representations and perceptual objects.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2009.09.003","volume":"13"},

Beat induction, the detection of a regular pulse in an auditory signal, is considered a fundamental human trait that, arguably, played a decisive role in the origin of music. Theorists are divided on the issue whether this ability is innate or learned. We show that newborn infants develop expectation for the onset of rhythmic cycles (the downbeat), even when it is not marked by stress or other distinguishing spectral features. Omitting the downbeat elicits brain activity associated with violating sensory expectations.

In this latent class weighted Euclidean model, the contribution to the distance function between two stimuli is per dimension weighted identically by all subjects in the same latent class. This model removes the rotational invariance of the classical multidimensional scaling model retaining psychologically meaningful dimensions, and drastically reduces the number of parameters in the traditional INDSCAL model. The probability density function for the data of a subject is posited to be a finite mixture of spherical multivariate normal densities. The maximum likelihood function is optimized by means of an EM algorithm; a modified Fisher scoring method is used to update the parameters in the M-step.

Wolfram lets the world see his work in <I>A New Kind of Science</I>, a gorgeous, 1,280-page tome more than a decade in the making. With patience, insight, and self-confidence to spare, Wolfram outlines a fundamental new way of modeling complex systems.<p> On the frontier of complexity science since he was a boy, Wolfram is a champion of cellular automata–256 \"programs\" governed by simple nonmathematical rules. He points out that even the most complex equations fail to accurately model biological systems, but the simplest cellular automata can produce results straight out of nature–tree branches, stream eddies, and leopard spots, for instance. The graphics in <I>A New Kind of Science</I> show striking resemblance to the patterns we see in nature every day.<p> Wolfram wrote the book in a distinct style meant to make it easy to read, even for nontechies; a basic familiarity with logic is helpful but not essential. Readers will find themselves swept away by the elegant simplicity of Wolfram's ideas and the accidental artistry of the cellular automaton models. Whether or not Wolfram's revolution ultimately gives us the keys to the universe, his new science is absolutely awe-inspiring. <I>–Therese Littleton</I> This long-awaited work from one of the world's most respected scientists presents a series of dramatic discoveries never before made public. Starting from a collection of simple computer experiments—illustrated in the book by striking computer graphics—Wolfram shows how their unexpected results force a whole new way of looking at the operation of our universe. <P>Wolfram uses his approach to tackle a remarkable array of fundamental problems in science: from the origin of the Second Law of thermodynamics, to the development of complexity in biology, the computational limitations of mathematics, the possibility of a truly fundamental theory of physics, and the interplay between free will and determinism. <P>Written with exceptional clarity, and illustrated by more than a thousand original pictures, this seminal book allows scientists and non-scientists alike to participate in what promises to be a major intellectual revolution.","author":[{"family":"Wolfram","given":"Stephen"}],"citation-key":"wolframNewKindScience2002","edition":"First","ISBN":"1-57955-008-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002,5]]},"note":"Published: Hardcover","publisher":"Wolfram Media","title":"A New Kind of Science","type":"book","URL":"http://www.worldcat.org/isbn/1579550088"},

  {"id":"woodWomenWorkWomen2019","abstract":"Several surviving artifacts of Roman imperial date consist of two small plaques designed for connection by balks (rectangular beams) and cylindrical dowels. All but one of the surviving specimens are of ivory and were probably luxurious versions of utilitarian objects. All have decorative details; three particularly lavish specimens bear mythological narratives in relief on both sides of each plaque. The original function of these objects is controversial, but the strongest evidence supports their identification as looms for weaving narrow strips to be used as decorative trim. If this reconstruction is correct, then their intended owners were primarily women, and the viewers of them were the members of those women's private households. Although most of the craftsmen who carved these very technically demanding works were probably male, the iconography of the decorated examples may reflect the social roles of their owners. The relief-decorated specimens in the Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Napoli and the Römisch-Germanisches Museum in Cologne appear to depict myths that concern childbirth and motherhood. This essay examines how the functions of these objects dictated the reading of their narrative content as their viewers interacted physically with them. The narratives delivered didactic, comforting, and stimulating messages.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,21]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Wood","given":"Susan"}],"citation-key":"woodWomenWorkWomen2019","container-title":"American Journal of Archaeology","DOI":"10.3764/aja.123.3.0411","ISSN":"0002-9114","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"page":"411-438","source":"JSTOR","title":"Women's Work and Women's Myths: Mothers and Children on Ivory Looms","title-short":"Women's Work and Women's Myths","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3764/aja.123.3.0411","volume":"123"},

Bannon had long sensed that deep within America’s soul lurked an explosive tension. Cambridge Analytica had the data to prove it, and in 2016 Bannon had a presidential campaign to use as his proving ground. Christopher Wylie might have seemed an unlikely figure to be at the center of such an operation. Canadian and liberal in his politics, he was only twenty-four when he got a job with a London firm that worked with the U.K. Ministry of Defense and was charged putatively with helping to build a team of data scientists to create new tools to identify and combat radical extremism online. In short order, those same military tools were turned to political purposes, and Cambridge Analytica was born. Wylie’s decision to become a whistleblower prompted the largest data-crime investigation in history. His story is both exposé and dire warning about a sudden problem born of very new and powerful capabilities. It has not only laid bare the profound vulnerabilities—and profound carelessness—in the enormous companies that drive the attention economy, it has also exposed the profound vulnerabilities of democracy itself.

Participants were asked to verbalize why they either liked or disliked two different kinds of paintings; one piece was representational, the other piece was abstract. Those who verbalized their reasons for liking the artworks were more likely to prefer the representational painting, whereas those who verbalized their reasons for disliking the paintings were also more likely to dislike the representational painting. While it was easy to describe reasons for both liking and disliking representational art, the same proved difficult for abstract art.

Another well-known idea, often espoused as being in opposition to the first proposal, is that processing of speech sounds entails general-purpose neural mechanisms sensitive to the acoustic features that are present in speech. Here, we suggest that these dichotomous views need not be mutually exclusive. Specifically, there is now extensive evidence that spectral and temporal acoustical properties predict the relative specialization of right and left auditory cortices, and that this is a parsimonious way to account not only for the processing of speech sounds, but also for non-speech sounds such as musical tones. We also point out that there is equally compelling evidence that neural responses elicited by speech sounds can differ depending on more abstract, linguistically relevant properties of a stimulus (such as whether it forms part of one's language or not). Tonal languages provide a particularly valuable window to understand the interplay between these processes. The key to reconciling these phenomena probably lies in understanding the interactions between afferent pathways that carry stimulus information, with top-down processing mechanisms that modulate these processes. Although we are still far from the point of having a complete picture, we argue that moving forward will require us to abandon the dichotomy argument in favour of a more integrated approach.","author":[{"family":"Zatorre","given":"Robert J."},{"family":"Gandour","given":"Jackson T."}],"citation-key":"zatorreNeuralSpecializationsSpeech2008","container-title":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rstb.2007.2161","ISSN":"1471-2970","issue":"1493","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,3]]},"page":"1087–1104","PMID":"17890188","title":"Neural specializations for speech and pitch: moving beyond the dichotomies","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2007.2161","volume":"363"},

  {"id":"zhangCreativeTryComposing2010","abstract":"Woven fabrics are widely used in clothing because of their parallel and interlaced properties, which are formed by weaving. Creating a weaving pattern, especially hand weaving for interlacing yarns is a cumbersome task in the textile industry. In this paper, we propose two kinds of playing for creating weaving patterns on multi-input devices: the tie-up plan and the lift plan. Discrete notes on the treble staff are translated into signatures of treadling sequences and discrete notes in the bass staff are translated into signatures of theadling sequences. Artists can use their right hand to compose a treadling sequence for weft yarns and their left hand to play a threading sequence for warp yarns. The treadling and threading sequences become the notes on the full gamut of shafts and treadles. Our result shows that we are able to compose a family of weaving patterns in a similar way to playing the piano in a short time.","author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jiahua"},{"family":"Baciu","given":"George"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Shuang"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Cheng"}],"citation-key":"zhangCreativeTryComposing2010","collection-title":"VRST '10","container-title":"Proceedings of the 17th ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology","DOI":"10.1145/1889863.1889890","event-place":"Hong Kong","ISBN":"978-1-4503-0441-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"page":"127–130","publisher":"ACM","publisher-place":"Hong Kong","title":"A Creative Try: Composing Weaving Patterns by Playing on a Multi-input Device","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1889863.1889890"},
  {"id":"zhangDynamicFMRIStudy2006","abstract":"Functional MRI (fMRI) combined with the paired-stimuli paradigms (referred as dynamic fMRI) was used to study the illusory double-flash effect on brain activity in the human visual cortex. Three experiments were designed. The first two experiments aimed to examine the cross-modal neural interaction between the visual and auditory sensory systems caused by the illusory double-flash effect using combined auditory (beep sound) and visual (light flash) stimuli. The fMRI signal in the visual cortex was significantly increased in response to the illusory double flashes compared to the physical single flash when the inter-stimuli delay between the auditory and visual stimuli was 25 ms. This increase disappeared when the delay was prolonged to ∼300 ms. These results reveal that the illusory double-flash effect can significantly affect the brain activity in the visual cortex, and the degree of this effect is dynamically sensitive to the inter-stimuli delay. The third experiment was to address the spatial differentiation of brain activation in the visual cortex in response to the illusory double-flash stimulation. It was found that the illusory double-flash effect in the human visual cortex is much stronger in the periphery than the fovea. This finding suggests that the periphery may be involved in high-level brain processing beyond the retinotopic visual perception. The behavioral measures conducted in this study indicate an excellent correlation between the fMRI results and behavioral performance. Finally, this work demonstrates a unique merit of fMRI for providing both temporal and spatial information regarding cross-modal neural interaction between different sensory systems.","author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Nanyin"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Wei"}],"citation-key":"zhangDynamicFMRIStudy2006","container-title":"Experimental Brain Research","DOI":"10.1007/s00221-005-0304-7","ISSN":"0014-4819","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,6]]},"page":"57–66","title":"A dynamic fMRI study of illusory double-flash effect on human visual cortex","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00221-005-0304-7","volume":"172"},
  {"id":"zimmermannMiningVersionHistories2005","abstract":"We apply data mining to version histories in order to guide programmers along related changes: \"Programmers who changed these functions also changed....\" Given a set of existing changes, the mined association rules 1) suggest and predict likely further changes, 2) show up item coupling that is undetectable by program analysis, and 3) can prevent errors due to incomplete changes. After an initial change, our ROSE prototype can correctly predict further locations to be changed; the best predictive power is obtained for changes to existing software. In our evaluation based on the history of eight popular open source projects, ROSE's topmost three suggestions contained a correct location with a likelihood of more than 70 percent.","author":[{"family":"Zimmermann","given":"T."},{"family":"Zeller","given":"A."},{"family":"Weissgerber","given":"P."},{"family":"Diehl","given":"S."}],"citation-key":"zimmermannMiningVersionHistories2005","container-title":"Software Engineering, IEEE Transactions on","container-title-short":"Software Engineering, IEEE Transactions on","DOI":"10.1109/tse.2005.72","ISSN":"0098-5589","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,6]]},"page":"429–445","title":"Mining version histories to guide software changes","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/tse.2005.72","volume":"31"},

Strudel is an attempt to make live coding more accessible, by creating a system that runs entirely in the browser, while opening Tidals approach to algorithmic patterns (Mclean 2020) up to modern audio/visual web technologies. The Strudel REPL is a live code editor dedicated to manipulating Strudel patterns while they play, with builtin visual feedback. While Strudel is written in JavaScript, the API is optimized for simplicity and readability by applying code transformations on the syntax tree level, allowing language operations that would otherwise be impossible. The application supports multiple ways to output sound, including Tone.js, Web Audio nodes, OSC (Open Sound Control) messages, Web Serial andWeb MIDI. The project is split into multiple packages, allowing granular reuse in other applications. Apart from TidalCycles, Strudel draws inspiration from many prior existing projects like TidalVortex (McLean et al. 2022), Gibber (Roberts and Kuchera-morin 2012), Estuary (Ogborn et al. 2017), Hydra (Jack [2022] 2022), Ocarina (Solomon [2021] 2022) and Feedforward (McLean 2020).","author":[{"family":"Roos", "given":"Felix "},{"family":"McLean","given":"Alex"}],"note":"Demo paper","event-place":"Cannes, France","type":"paper-conference","event":"Web Audio Conference 2022 (WAC 2022)"}
